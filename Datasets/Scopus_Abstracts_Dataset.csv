The effects of different sintering temperatures on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the alloy were systematically studied. The MoNbVTa0.5Cr RHEA milled up to 60 h was found to have a metastable dual-phase containing a major BCC (a = 3.1474 Å) and Nb-Ta (a = 3.3058 Å) phase. The sintered MoNbVTa0.5Cr RHEA was composed of BCC phase and a small amount of Ta2VO6 at different sintering temperatures. There were a lot of edge dislocations in the BCC matrix near the BCC/Ta2VO6 interface. With the increase of sintering temperature, the grain size of sintered MoNbVTa0.5Cr RHEA gradually increased, while the mechanical properties gradually decreased with the increase of sintering temperature. When the sintering temperature was 1500 °C, the grain size of the alloy was 2.33 μm, the yield strength was 2783 MPa, the compressive strength was 3346 MPa, and the fracture strain was 20.45 %, showing the best comprehensive properties. And the density of MoNbVTa0.5Cr RHEA was 9.11 g·cm−3 and 26 % lower than that of WNbMoTaV RHEA. The specific yield strength of MoNbVTa0.5Cr RHEA prepared in this research was 295.28 kPa·m3·kg−1, which was superior to most RHEAs reported so far. This sintered MoNbVTa0.5Cr RHEA showed an excellent room temperature compression performance, which can be attributed to the co-existence of BCC phase along with the minor Ta2VO6 phases. The high yield strength of MoNbVTa0.5Cr RHEA was mainly attributed to the substitutional solid solution strengthening of metal atoms, the interstitial solid solution strengthening of O atoms and the grain boundary strengthening of ultrafine grains, with contributions to yield strength of 41 %, 28 %, and 24 %, respectively. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",

In present work, a novel design strategy based on tailoring element distribution is proposed to achieve excellent high-temperature strength at a density lower than 7 g cm−3. Specifically, a Ti40Nb15Mo30(NbC)15 composite was designed and prepared by powder metallurgy. The composite is found to be composed of two ultrafine-grained (UFG) phases including a body-centered cubic (bcc) solid-solution phase and a face-centered cubic (fcc) ceramic reinforcement phase (Ti, Nb)C. The as-sintered composite shows a uniform and UFG microstructure where two phases are interconnected. Due to this unique microstructure, the Ti40Nb15Mo30(NbC)15 composite displays superb specific yield strengths among surveyed RHEAs, complex concentrated alloys, and metal-matrix composites from 800 °C (243 MPa g−1 cm3) to 1000 °C (127 MPa g−1 cm3). The outstanding high-temperature compressive strength was found to be associated with high resistance to dislocation motion and strong dislocation interactions in both the bcc and fcc phases. The phase interface after hot compression remained semi-coherent, vindicating its high stability. The high-density of stable phase interfaces not only retards the dislocation motion due to the large image force near the phase boundary but also induces a high value of activation energy for diffusion. The high activation energy can further achieve significant microstructure stability even after a long-term annealing (36 h) at 1000 °C. This work provides new perspectives for the design and application of light and ultrastrong refractory complex concentrated alloys (RCCAs) by comparison to the insufficient strength of many traditional and light RCCAs. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",

Here, a set of five Re0.1HfxTa1.6W0.4(TaC)y refractory medium-entropy alloys (RMEAs) were fabricated using the vacuum arc melting technique, and the effect of Hf and C on the microstructures and mechanical properties of these alloys was investigated. These RMEAs exhibit excellent high-temperature strength and favorable plasticity at room-temperature. The microstructures of the Re0.1HfxTa1.6W0.4(TaC)y alloys are hypoeutectic or eutectic structures, consisting of BCC solid solution and primary and secondary carbides. The carbides can be classified into two types: M2C and MC. Hf and C have an important influence on the grain size, carbide type and spatial configuration of the alloy, and in turn, influence the mechanical properties of the alloy. For instance, the content of MC-type carbides is proportional to the addition of Hf element, whereby a higher proportion of Hf results in reduced plasticity at room-temperature and enhanced softening resistance at elevated temperatures in the alloy. The carbides and BCC matrix exhibit synergistic strengthening behavior. The ultimate compressive strength of the five Re0.1HfxTa1.6W0.4(TaC)y alloys at 1450 °C is >950 MPa, while maintaining a fracture strain exceeding 11% at room-temperature. Notably, the Re0.1Hf0.1Ta1.6W0.4(TaC)0.25 alloy demonstrates a compressive strength of 1110 MPa at 1450 °C, which is 2.3 times greater than that of the NbMoTaW alloy at 1400 °C. Additionally, the fracture strain of the Re0.1Hf0.1Ta1.6W0.4(TaC)0.25 alloy at room-temperature is 16.9%, which is 8 times higher than that of the NbMoTaW alloy. The Re0.1HfxTa1.6W0.4(TaC)y alloy exhibit excellent mechanical properties at both room and high temperatures, making it a potential candidate for applications in fields that require high strength at ultra-high temperatures. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",

The phase composition, microstructure, and mechanical properties of the high-entropy alloy coatings were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Vickers hardness testing and universal friction wear testing. The results showed that high-entropy alloy coatings retained a body-centered cubic structure after different aging heat treatments.

Here, the microstructures and mechanical properties of N-free and N-doped Ti2ZrNbV0.5Mo0.2 HEAs before and after He irradiation were investigated. The results showed that the solid solution strengthening caused by interstitial N improved the yield strength at room temperature and 1023 K without significantly reducing plasticity. N doping significantly promoted the growth, aggregation and wider spatial distribution of He bubbles by enhancing the mobility of He atoms/He-vacancy complexes, with the average size of He bubbles increasing from 10.4 nm in N-free HEA to 31.0 nm in N-doped HEA. In addition, N-doped HEA showed a much higher irradiation hardness increment and hardening fraction than N-free HEA. Contrary to conventional materials doped with N, the introduction of N into Ti2ZrNbV0.5Mo0.2 HEA had adverse effects on its resistance to He bubble growth and irradiation hardening.

For certain alloy systems, such as Mo–Ti–Cr–Al, both disordered (A2) and ordered (B2) crystal structures are possible. In this particular system, a solid-state transformation from A2 to B2 during cooling occurs. For Al concentrations above ≈10 at%, B2 order is obtained from the transformation temperature down to room temperature (RT), while A2 is stable above RT below the critical Al content. Herein, two alloys from the Mo–Ti–Cr–Al system close to the transition between A2 and B2 are investigated. Nanoindentation tests reveal that the magnitude of strain rate sensitivity for both alloys is small compared to classical alloys, however, significantly temperature dependent up to the strength plateau temperatures. The yield strength plateau, which is insensitive to the strain rate, is observed at temperatures exceeding 573 K. Modeling of solid solution strengthening reproduces the experimental data in the Al-lean A2 alloys. However, the observed discontinuous increase of strength in the Al-rich B2 alloys can only be rationalized by the appearance of B2 order and to no significant other obvious strengthening mechanisms. © 2024 The Authors.

The static/dynamic compression experiments of HfZrTiTaNbCu x at different strain rates were carried out by universal testing machine and split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB), respectively. The static/dynamic compression stress–strain relationships of HfZrTiTaNbCu x with different contents of trace elements were obtained. The Johnson–Cook dynamic constitutive equation parameters suitable for HfZrTiTaNbCu x high entropy alloy were determined by fitting, and the accuracy of the dynamic constitutive equation parameters was verified by ABAQUS numerical simulation. The results showed that under quasi-static loading conditions, the I-II composite cracks occurred, and the material exhibited an obvious work hardening phenomenon. The yield strength and compressive strength of the high entropy alloy increased with the increase in Cu content, but the toughness decreased. The strain rate effect was obvious under dynamic loading.

For this purpose, four datasets were generated by mining the data available in literature, containing room temperature strength, high temperature strength, room temperature ductility and hardness, which were trained by three different ML models, namely the support vector regression, random forest, and artificial neural network. As a result, three novel RHEA compositions were predicted, and their performances were experimentally validated.

Some of these alloys demonstrated an excellent combination of high-temperature strength and room-temperature tensile ductility provided by the formation of a structure consisting of body-centred cubic (bcc) matrix and B2 nanodomains/particles. However, oxidation resistance and phase stability, and, more importantly, the resulting mechanical properties of the Al-containing RH/MEAs, which are critical characteristics for high-temperature structural materials, remain unexplored. Herein, these aspects were extensively investigated for the Al7.5(NbTiZr)92.5 (in at%) alloy having an initial bcc + B2 structure. The alloy was subjected to long-term (500 h) annealing or oxidation tests at 600, 700, and 800 °C followed by the evaluation of mechanical properties during uniaxial tension at 22 and 600 °C. Microstructural studies of the specimens exposed to long-term annealing showed the formation of Zr5Al3 particles that precipitated along the grain boundaries and within grain interiors. The volume fraction of these particles was the highest (∼16 %) after annealing at 600 °C and the lowest (∼0.5 %) after annealing at 800 °C. Oxidation tests revealed that the alloy was prone to pesting phenomena, which intensified with the temperature. The alloy could sustain pesting only up to 10 h at 600 °C, while it experienced a complete disintegration into powder after 5 h at 800 °C. The poor oxidation resistance originated from the formation of volumetric, non-protective (Al,Nb,Ti,Zr)O4 oxide. While insignificantly affecting the strength, long-term annealing or oxidation deteriorated the ductility of the Al7.5(NbTiZr)92.5 alloy both at 22 and 600 °C. The Zr5Al3 phase embrittled the alloy after long-term annealing at 600 or 700 °C, but marginally reduced the ductility in the 800°C-annealed specimens due to the low volume fraction and relatively homogeneous distribution of this phase. The oxidation for 1 h decreased the room-temperature ductility owing to the premature macroscopic localisation of plastic deformation induced by synergistic effects from the volumetric (Al,Nb,Ti,Zr)O4 oxide.

The VNbTa alloy exhibits high tension strength (σ0.2 = 1033 MPa), outstanding fracture elongation (εf >19 %), super rolling formability (>80 % thickness reduction), and work hardening at room temperature (RT). The high strength of VNbTa alloy is mainly associated with solid solution strengthening and local lattice distortion induced by the misfits of atomic sizes and mechanical moduli of various elements. The super formability of VNbTa alloy attributes to the mobility of a/2<1 1 1>-type dislocations and the formation of kink bands at RT.

The phonon density of states is determined from the velocity auto-correlation function and chemical SRO modifies the high-frequency part of the phonon density of states. Lattice heat conductivity is calculated by non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. The heat conductivity of the random alloy is lower than that of the segregated binary alloys. Phonon scattering by SRO precipitates might be expected to reduce scattering times and, therefore, decrease thermal conductivity. We find that, in contrast, due to the increase of the conductivity alongside SRO cluster percolation pathways, SRO increases the lattice heat conductivity by around 12 %.

The high solubility of oxygen causes brittleness in these metals. When designing a refractory high entropy alloy, efforts should be focused on reducing oxygen solubility. We find that the high solubility of oxygen is related to the thermodynamic stability of oxygen interstitials in pure refractory metals. To understand the impact of alloy composition on oxygen solubility in refractory alloys, we examine the thermodynamic stability of oxygen interstitials across various refractory binary alloys. Using first-principles Density Functional Theory (DFT), we calculate the Oxygen Interstitial Formation Energy (OIFE) of nine refractory metals and their 24 equiatomic binary alloys. The OIFE is determined by the bond strength between oxygen and the nearest neighbor (NN) metal atoms. It is a strong function of the nature of NN atoms that surround the interstitial site rather than the overall composition of the alloy. For a given alloy, the OIFE can vary based on the NN atoms around the oxygen interstitial. These observations indicate that an alloy with even a small amount of metal of high oxygen affinity (or highly negative OIFE), like Ti, can result in the high stability of oxygen in specific interstitial sites where the nearest neighbors are predominantly Ti atoms. It also explains Re as a choice of alloying elements to ductilize W instead of Ti. Although both Ti and Re alloying in W similarly improve its ductility, Ti's tendency to stabilize oxygen interstitials makes the W-Ti alloy brittle, while Re does not stabilize oxygen interstitials. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.jallcom.2024.175765

Therefore, further enhancements are required to improve their friction and wear properties under RT. In this context, the development of NbMoWTa(h-BN)x RHEA ceramic composites in this work offers a viable solution to address this issue. Experimental results demonstrate that the addition of h-BN leads to the in-situ generation of (Nb,Ta)N/(Nb,Ta)2N and (Nb,Ta)B2 ceramic phases, significantly enhancing the hardness and wear resistance of the composites. The wear rate of NbMoWTa(h-BN)0.5 reaching as low as 1.32 × 10−8 mm3/Nm, which is four orders of magnitude lower than that of the RHEA. The NbMoWTa RHEA exhibits significant adhesive wear, which can be effectively mitigated in composites through the uniform dispersion of ceramic phase particles with lower mean free path. The abrasive particles primarily interact with the hard strengthening phase, effectively inhibiting plastic deformation in their vicinity. Consequently, the reduced mean free path between the ceramic phases limits the likelihood of metal matrix removal.

The effect of Cr content on microstructure and mechanical properties of the MoNbVTa0.5Crx RHEAs was systematically studied. The results showed the addition of Cr could refine the microstructure, decrease density and increase strength of RHEAs. The microstructure of the sintered alloy was composed of BCC phase and a small amount of oxide phase (Ta2VO6), and Ta2OV6 (200) has a semi-coherent relationship with BCC phase (110), with a lattice mismatch degree of 7.34 %. The compressive yield strength of the MoNbVTa0.5Crx RHEAs initially increased and then decreased with increasing Cr content. The MoNbVTa0.5Cr0.75 RHEAs demonstrated the best mechanical properties, and the compressive yield strength and ultimate compressive strength at room temperature were 3180 MPa and 3596 MPa, respectively, which were far higher than traditional WNbMoTaV RHEAs. And the density of MoNbVTa0.5Cr0.75 RHEAs was 21 % lower than that of sintered WNbMoTaV RHEAs. The strengthening mechanism of sintered MoNbVTa0.5Crx RHEAs involved O/C atoms interstitial solid solution strengthening, grain boundary strengthening, and metal atoms solid solution strengthening, while the contribution of oxide precipitation strengthening was negligible. © 2024",10.1016/j.ijrmhm.2024.106857

The Si mean content is controlled by tailoring the power discharge applied to the Si target. The deposition process led to a nano-layered architecture where Si3N4 (amorphous) and TiTaZrHfW-N (nano-crystalized NaCl FCC type structure) are alternated. By increasing the thickness of Si3N4 nano-layers, the Si mean content increases. All coatings are found to have good thermal stability after annealing under vacuum at 900 °C. Increasing Si mean content reduces the film's hardness; however, the annealing treatment at 900 °C improves it. A super-hardness of 41 GPa is found for the post-annealed Si-free film.

However, the enormous composition space has severely hindered the development of novel LW-RHEAs with excellent comprehensive performance. In this paper, an machine learning (ML)-based alloy design strategy combined with a multi-objective optimization method was proposed and applied for a rational design of Al-Nb-Ti-V-Zr-Cr-Mo-Hf LW-RHEAs. The quantitative relation of “composition-structure-property” was first established by ML modeling. Then, feature analysis reveals that Cr content greater than 12 at.% is a key criterion for alloys with high corrosion resistance. The phase structure, density, melting point, hardness and corrosion resistance of the alloys were screened layer by layer, and finally, three LW-RHEAs with superb hard and corrosion resistance were successfully designed. Key experimental validation indicates that three target alloys have densities around 6.5 g/cm3, and all alloys are disordered bcc_A2 single-phase with the highest hardness of 593 HV and the largest pitting potential of 2.5 VSCE, which far exceeds all the literature reports.

The framework is grounded on efficient on-lattice structure and chemistry representation combined with artificial neural networks, enabling precise prediction of all path-dependent migration barriers and individual atom jumps. To demonstrate the method, we study the temperature-dependent local chemical ordering in a refractory NbMoTa alloy and reveal a critical temperature at which the B2 order reaches a maximum.

The results show that the addition of Si leads to the formation of hard and brittle M5Si3-type (M = Ti and Nb) phase at the grain boundary of the matrix, which gradually transforms the alloys from a single body centered cubic (BCC) structure to a dual-phase structure. While the density of AlMo0.5NbTiVSix alloys decreases from 6.01 to 5.59 g/cm3 with the increase of Si content, and the mechanical properties are also significantly improved, AlMo0.5NbTiVSi0.5 alloy has the best yield strength of 1428 and 390 MPa at 1073 K and 1273 K, respectively. Among them, AlMo0.5NbTiVSi0.1 alloy has the best compression ductility strain at 1073 K, up to 22.2 %, indicating that the addition of appropriate Si can improve the compression ductility of the alloy, which is also caused by the combination of grain refinement and the appearance of eutectic structure. On the one hand, the segregation of Si elements at grain boundaries results in slow growth of the primary crystal, which inhibits the growth of grains. On the other hand, the eutectic structure composed of M5Si3 and BCC is distributed at the grain boundary, which is not conducive to the growth of grains, and the combined effect of the two eventually leads to the grain refinement. The strengthening mechanisms of the alloys can be attributed to the second phase strengthening, solid solution strengthening and grain refinement strengthening.

Solid-solution strengthening largely controls the variation in strength, ductility, and thermal stability of RHEAs. © The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society 2024.",10.1007/s11837-024-06847-1

RMPEAs can be designed to exhibit a wide range of properties by tailoring their composition. However, the vast chemical design space makes brute-force experimental screening inefficient and costly. In this work, we follow a closed-loop, iterative computational/experimental screening approach that combines computational alloy design methodologies with high-throughput synthesis and characterization tools to explore the vast RMPEAs space and design new RMPEAs that satisfy multiple objectives and constraints. In particular, we targeted compositions with yield strengths higher than 50 MPa at 2000 °C, W content of more than 30 at.% for high-temperature strength and operability up to 2000 °C, narrow solidification range for additive manufacturability, competitive ductility metrics, among other property constraints. We evaluated the mechanical properties and microstructure of 58 alloys designed in 5 batches, in both as-cast and homogenized conditions, synthesized using vacuum arc melting, utilizing scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Vickers microhardness, nanoindentation, and high-temperature compression testing. Based on the microhardness screening experiments in each batch, the best-performing alloys were selected for scale-up. High-temperature compression at 1800 °C was performed in these alloys, demonstrating that the designed alloys exhibit up to five times higher yield strength than a pure tungsten benchmark. We conclude that W-containing RMPEAs designed in this study merit further consideration for next-generation structural materials for ultra-high temperature applications. © 2024",10.1016/j.actamat.2024.120379

Finer and short-range ordering structures were observed in the remelted sample, whereas the Al-deposited sample showcased the formation of silicide and intermetallic phases. High-temperature cyclic and isothermal oxidation tests at 1000 °C were carried out. The total weight gain after 60 h of cyclic oxidation decreased by 17.49 % and 30.46 % for the remelted and deposited samples, respectively, compared to the as-cast state. Oxidation kinetics reveal an evident lower mass gain and oxidation rate in the treated samples.

Following the original polynomial interpolation idea of the MTPs, the eMTPs are defined as polynomials of vibrational and electronic degrees of freedom, corrected to have a finite interatomic cutoff. Practically, an eMTP is constructed from the classical MTPs fitted to a training set, whose energies and forces are calculated with electronic temperatures corresponding to the Chebyshev nodes on a given temperature interval. The eMTP energy is hence a Chebyshev interpolation of the classical MTPs. Using the eMTP, one can obtain the temperature-dependent vibrational free energy including anharmonicity coming from phonon interactions, the electronic free energy coming from electron interactions, and the coupling of atomic vibrations and electronic excitations. Each of the contributions can be accessed individually using the proposed formalism. The performance of eMTPs is demonstrated for two refractory systems which have a significant electronic, vibrational and coupling contribution up to the melting point—unary Nb, and a disordered TaVCrW high-entropy alloy. Highly accurate thermodynamic and kinetic quantities can now be obtained just by using eMTPs, without any further ab initio calculations.

The incorporation of Al element significantly enhanced the forming quality of coatings, resulting in nearly defect-free coatings with a thickness of 1.2–1.4 mm. Microstructural analysis revealed that the coatings were primarily composed of body-centered cubic (BCC) solid solution and C15-Laves phase. Due to the influence of a single brittle BCC phase, the Al-free coating exhibited high strength and brittleness, leading to numerous defects caused by thermal stress. The introduction of Al element refined the microstructure and facilitated the formation of Laves phases at grain boundaries, thereby alleviating stress to a certain extent. Consequently, the microhardness of the RHEAcs was significantly higher than that of the substrate, with the Al-free coating achieving the highest microhardness of 1250 HV, which was 5.89 times that of the substrate. Wear resistance results indicated that, prior to annealing, RHEAcs with varying Al content outperformed 316L stainless steel. Post-annealing, the coatings exhibited significantly lower friction coefficients compared with the annealed 316L substrate. The Al-free coating showed significant accumulation of abrasive particles, leading to severe abrasive and oxidative wear.

Similar to V-4Cr-4Ti, HfNbTiZr possesses high phase stability and surface erosion resistance to irradiation with He ions up to 5 × 1017 cm-2. Using transmission electron microscopy, a more than 2-fold increase in overall swelling, as well as its intensification with increasing fluence was observed for HfNbTiZr compared to V-4Cr-4Ti. Combining atomistic calculations and simulations based on the Modified Embedded Atom Method interatomic potential and Density Functional Theory, the energetics of defects and helium-vacancy complexes, as well as their dynamics, were studied for alloys. It was shown that in the HfNbTiZr and dilute vanadium alloys the number of radiation-induced vacancies (v) can be comparable. According to the binding energy curves, there is a tendency for higher He accumulation in helium-vacancy complexes due to the increased He/v ratio in HfNbTiZr compared to V-4Cr-4Ti (∼1.5 versus ∼1.1). It was found that the kick-out of lattice atoms is enhanced in HfNbTiZr and is suppressed in V-4Cr-4Ti. Therefore, the more intense He bubble growth in HfNbTiZr may be due to the kick-out mechanism, which leads to a decrease in the He/v ratio and stimulates helium-vacancy complexes to trap additional He atoms.

In this study, an ultrafine-grained (UFG) NbMoTaW alloy with high grain-boundary cohesion was prepared by powder metallurgy, taking advantages of rapid hot-pressing sintering and full-process inert atmosphere protection from powder synthesis to sintering. By oxygen control and an increase in the proportion of grain boundaries, the segregation of oxygen and formation of oxides at grain boundaries were strongly mitigated, thus the intrinsic high cohesion of the interfaces was preserved. Compared to the coarse-grained alloys prepared by arc-melting and those sintered by traditional powder metallurgy methods, the UFG NbMoTaW alloy demonstrated simultaneously increased strength and plasticity at ambient temperature.

Fully-recrystallized specimens were fabricated by cold rolling and subsequent annealing, and uniaxial tensile deformation was applied at room temperature. Slip trace morphologies on the surfaces of the tensile-deformed materials were quantitatively characterized, and the so-called ψ and χ relationships of the observed slip traces were evaluated by a newly developed method for polycrystalline specimens. Wavy slip traces were observed in most grains in the pure Nb. They consisted of low-indexed slip planes, such as {1 1 0}, and {1 1 2}, and high-indexed (or undetermined) slip planes. Some straight slip traces persisting on the low-indexed slip planes were also found in the pure Nb. In contrast, straight slip traces were dominant in the RMEA. The straight slip traces in the RMEA were not parallel to particular slip planes but mostly distributed along the maximum shear stress plane (MSSP), indicating that frequent cross slip in very short intervals occurred. Large deviations of slip planes from the MSSP in a few grains of the RMEA were attributed to the slip transfer from neighboring grains as a characteristic of polycrystalline materials. Frequent cross slip in short intervals, attributed to homogeneous slip resistance distribution for screw dislocations in the RMEA originating from the chemical heterogeneity on an atomic scale, was proposed as a novel mechanism responsible for the unique slip behavior and macroscopic deformation behavior. © 2024",10.1016/j.jmst.2024.05.029

Despite their potential, achieving an optimal strength-ductility balance in these lightweight alloys remains an emerging field of study. In this study, Al0.8Nb0.5Ti2V2Zrx (x = 0, 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9) alloys were prepared by vacuum arc melting. A comprehensive evaluation of their microstructure, density, hardness, and compressive behavior at both room and 873 K temperatures was conducted. The introduction of Zr transforms the alloy phase structure from body-centered cubic (BCC) to BCC + C14-Laves. The areal fraction of the C14-Laves phase increased from 0 % to 32.47 % with increasing Zr content from x = 0 to 0.9, respectively. Furthermore, the Zr content had an obvious effect on the mechanical properties of the alloys. The compressive strength and hardness of the alloys improved, but the ductility simultaneously decreased, with increasing Zr content. The yield strengths of the alloys with x = 0, 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9 reached 971, 1216, 1483, and 1714 MPa, respectively, at room temperature, and 946, 1287, 1319, and 1469 MPa, respectively, at 873 K. In addition, the alloys maintained their deformation resistance and good ductility at 873 K. In particular, the Al0.8Nb0.5Ti2V2Zr0.3 exhibited a good balance between strength and ductility at room and 873 K temperatures due to the strengthening effect of a granular secondary phase.

Apparent irradiation hardening was observed in all the coatings except the TiNbZrCrV coating. The structural stability of these coatings under the current irradiation condition was discussed. Preliminary study shows that the great irradiation tolerance of amorphous TiNbZrCrV coating may be related to the lowest electronegativity difference (Δχ = 0.121) and large atomic size difference (δ = 9.042 %) that stabilize the structure and inhibit atomic diffusion, respectively.

Current studies have shown that the chemical short-range order (CSRO) usually exists in HEAs, which has a significant effect on the mechanical properties and irradiation resistance of HEAs. Refractory high entropy alloys (RHEAs), as a new class of HEAs have better mechanical properties at high temperatures than face-centered cubic (FCC) HEAs, and therefore have better prospects of application in the nuclear field. In this study, CSRO and its effect on the irradiation resistance of HfNbTaTiZr are analyzed via molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC). The primary cascade simulations, multi-cascade simulations and surface bombardment simulations are carried out to simulate the generation and accumulation of irradiation damage. The results of the primary cascade simulations and surface bombardment simulations of CSRO models show that the presence of CSRO induces cascade splitting into subcascades. The presence of subcascades reduces the thermal peak enhancement effect and thus lowers the recombination rate of Frenkel pairs (FPs) in the damage zone when FPs concentrations are low. However, the creation of subcascades increases the size of the damage zone caused by the cascade. Thus, when the concentrations of FPs are high, the larger area of damage zone allows more of the already existing FPs to be included, thus promoting their recombination, i.e., impedes their accumulation when concentrations are high. These subcascades lower the recombination of FPs at low FPs concentrations but inhibit their accumulation at high FPs concentrations. The presence of CSRO is also beneficial in inhibiting the growth of point defect clusters, which further improves the resistance of HfNbTaTiZr to dislocation generation. Furthermore, the presence of CSRO facilitates the irradiation-induced phase transition. But it is found that HfNbTaTiZr shows suppression of hexagonal close-packed (HCP) cluster growth. And the tendency to break down large HCP clusters into smaller ones is demonstrated in the CSRO model. From our calculations we also find that the irradiation-induced HCP atoms have a higher potential energy relative to the matrix. The potential energy difference between those energetic HCP atoms and the matrix can lead to generating a great number of insurmountable barriers pervading the matrix and largely suppressing the long-term mobility of FPs, thus limiting their aggregation and growth into clusters. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.ijplas.2024.104155

Here, we simulate threshold displacement energies in equiatomic MoNbTaVW using an accurate machine-learned interatomic potential, covering the full angular space of crystal directions. The effects of local chemical ordering are assessed by comparing results in random and short-range-ordered MoNbTaVW. The average threshold displacement energy in the random alloy is 44.3±0.15eV, and slightly higher, 48.6±0.15eV, in the short-range-ordered alloy. Both are significantly lower than in any of the constituent pure metals. We identify the mechanisms of defect creation and find they are mainly dependent on the masses of the recoiling and colliding elements. Low thresholds are generally found when heavy atoms (W, Ta) displace and replace the lightest atoms (V). The average threshold energies, when separated by recoiling element, are consequently ordered inversely according to their mass, opposite to the trend in the pure metals where W has by far the highest thresholds.

Both the preexisting edge dislocations (EDs) and screw dislocations (SDs) can significantly impact the irradiation performance of RHEAs. To explore the influence of preexisting dislocations on the generation and evolution of irradiation point defects in the RHEA WTaCrV, the interactions between preexisting dislocations (including EDs and SDs) and displacement cascades are studied by molecular dynamics simulations in this work. In addition, the results of the RHEA WTaCrV without preexisting dislocations and of pure W with preexisting dislocations are included for comparison. It is found that the presence of preexisting dislocations leads to a significant increase in the number of remained point defects after the cascades. However, the absorption of vacancies by dislocation cores in the RHEA WTaCrV is more significant than that in the pure W. Therefore, preexisting dislocations can reduce the possibility of void formation and act as sites for recombination of vacancies and interstitials in the subsequent long-term evolution. For the preexisting EDs in the RHEA WTaCrV, the local pinning of EDs, the attraction of vacancies, and the severe lattice distortion jointly cause the bowing out of EDs, which is conductive to accommodate vacancies. For the preexisting SDs, the abundant cross kinks tend to bind vacancies or interstitials, promoting the motion of SDs as well as the annihilation of point defects.

The yield strength of the alloy is about 1011 MPa with the tensile ductility of ∼12.6 %. Interestingly, the SHR of the alloy is very low, far below 1 GPa. The stress-strain curve of the alloy does not only show no premature dropout, but also exhibits a flat plateau-type curve. For this interesting phenomenon, the deformation mechanisms of Hf10Nb12Ti40V38 alloy are systematically investigated by investigating the deformation microstructures. The results indicate that the dislocation modes are diversifying, but the limited number of tangles generated by the intersection of dislocation channels are the main source of SHR. Various dislocation configurations such as single dislocation channel and cross-slip are stimulated sequentially, and although they have no positive effect on the SHR of the alloy, they allow alloy to accommodate plastic deformation. Combined with the kink bands as a strain softening mechanism, it improves the ductility while decreasing the SHR. Multiple dislocation channels interactions and kink bands are clearly identified as the two deformation mechanisms governing strain hardening and strain softening. The competition between two mechanisms generates the phenomenon mentioned above.

The dual-BCC-phase structure and the dislocations for the NbMoTaWHf RHEA were characterized. The compressive yield strengths of the NbMoTaWHf RHEA at room temperature, 1200, 1600, and 1800 °C were 1730, 1088, 390, and 312 MPa, respectively. The alloy displayed plastic deformation behaviors and dual-BCC-phase structure stability after compressing at 1600 and 1800 °C. The superb high-temperature strength was mainly ascribed to the high softening temperature, second-phase strengthening, and solid-solution strengthening. This work provides a promising high-temperature structural material with improved room-temperature ductility and high strength at elevated temperatures and enriches the database of the NbMoTaW-based RHEAs. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.intermet.2024.108515

Their high-temperature resistance to softening and high microstructure stability in a wide temperature range are also essential to sustaining their performance due to being used in harsh, high-temperature situations. In this work, the high-temperature tensile behavior of Al0.3NbTi3VZr1.5 LRHEA fabricated by laser additive manufacturing has been systematically investigated from 400 °C to 800 °C, and the relationship between the deformed microstructure and the mechanical behavior was revealed, and analyzing the reasons for the thermodynamic instability of the solid solution in LRHEA are discussed in detail. It is found that the weakening of the high entropy effect at intermediate temperatures reduces the stability of the solid solution, and the accelerated diffusion between elements further promotes the solid solution destabilization, mainly manifested as the Laves phase and the local chemical fluctuation (LCFs). The high dislocation density introduced by the additive manufacturing technology leads to the irregular connection of the Laves phases within the grains, and it can be improved by grain growth. The high negative mixing enthalpy competes with the high-entropy effect, and temperature is the decisive factor. In this situation, the atomic clusters were promoted and induced spinodal decomposition for generating LCFs. The formation of LCFs exhibits solute competition with the emergence of the C14 Laves phase, and the phase proportions fluctuate at different temperatures.

To understand the contribution of alloying element to the passivation and dissolution characteristics of HEAs is crucial for comprehending the synergistic effects of these elements. As a common refractory metal employed in HT environments, molybdenum (Mo) has faced controversy due to issues such as the formation of secondary phases and brittle oxide. To delve deeper into the mechanistic role and associated impacts of Mo in passivating oxidation, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of Mo's characteristics at electronic, atomic and macroscopic thermodynamic levels, which reveals that Mo's application scenario in passivating oxidation differs from the acknowledged ability of Cr to form stable protective oxide. This analysis was based on Density Functional Theory, Monte Carlo (MC) and Local Self-consistent Multiple Scattering (LSMS) methods. Although there is significant local lattice distortion induced by Mo and lattice expansion induced by oxygen (O) atom in bulk structures, thereby reducing the mechanical properties of Mo-containing HEAs, it exhibits stronger ductility in grain boundary (GB) regions compared to Cr-containing HEAs. From this, we propose design principles for enhancing the passivating oxidation quality of Mo-containing transition HEAs, encompassing factors such as chemical affinity, atomic size and microstructure. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.jallcom.2024.177026

HEA-base wetted the graphite well after 5 min and the wetting behaviour significantly improved for HEA-Mo after the same contact time. HEA-Ta, after initial melting and wetting stage, solidified due to high-melting phases formation. All the graphite/HEA samples formed refractory carbides.

However, the RHEAs are usually thermally metastable and brittle phases can be precipitated in intermediate temperature (such as 500–700℃), which severely limit the preparation of large-sized RHEAs ingots in industrial production. In this paper, we propose an alloy optimization strategy to suppress the precipitation of TiZrNb-based RHEAs by adding interstitial atomic oxygen (O). The results show that the precipitation temperature region of brittle phases can be reduced from 500°C∼650°C to 550°C∼600°C after adding oxygen, and the temperature region is reduced by more than 66 %. Moreover, the growth rate of precipitated phase decrease from 4.1 × 10−23 m3/s to 1.9 × 10−24 m3/s after adding oxygen, which is reduced by more than ten times. The analysis shows that adding oxygen inhibits the diffusion rate of Zr at intermediate temperature, thus delaying the formation of Zr-rich phase. Based on this, TiZrNb-based RHEAs with oxygen can well keep the outstanding ductility even after annealing at intermediate temperature for 4 hours, while the TiZrNb-based RHEAs without oxygen show ∼50 % ductility loss after the same annealing treatment.

The FCC precipitates contain high-density stacking faults, acting as a dislocation source under compressive loading. The HCP phase in the eutectic microstructures, in turn, acts as a strong barrier to dislocation movement and simultaneously increases the dislocation storage capacity. These findings open a new route to tailor the microstructure and mechanical properties of RH/MEAs. © 2024",10.1016/j.jmst.2024.06.034

The strength and flow stress of nanocrystalline RHEA (NC-RHEA) under tensile loadings are explored versus decreasing grain size d. The transition from classical Hall-Petch (HP) strengthening to inverse HP softening at a critical grain size dc = 5.91 nm is attributed to the change of plastic deformation mechanisms from dislocation emission and phase transformation to grain boundary (GB) activities. Besides, the intragranular TBs considerably enhance the strength of nanotwinned RHEA (NT-RHEA); the enhancing effect reduces with decreasing twin thickness λ. As the volume fraction of GB increases with decreasing d, GB activities dominate the plasticity of NT-RHEA and cause comparable mechanical properties with NC-RHEA. Moreover, the influences of dislocation glide, phase transformation and twinning on the mechanical properties of RHEA are quantified and separately analyzed to further verify our simulation results. Findings of this study not only promote insights into the nanostructure-property relation of HfNbZrTi, but also shed the light on performance enhancement through nanostructural design. © 2024",10.1016/j.ijrmhm.2024.106885

Here we show a low-frequency electrical conductivity model for the Nb-Mo-Ta-W HEA system. The cocktail effect is found to explain trends in electrical-conductivity changes in HEAs, while the magnitude of the reduction is understood by the calculated plasma frequency, free electron density, and measured relaxation time by terahertz spectroscopy. As a result, the refractory HEA Nb15Mo35Ta15W35 thin film exhibits both high hardness and excellent conductivity.

Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy images were used to analyze the effect of VHT temperature and time on matrix grain size and precipitated phase evolution. Results showed that both the precipitated phase and matrix grain size exhibited excellent thermal stability in the P/M ultra-fine-grained MoNbTaTiV RHEA. After an 8 h heat treatment at 1573 K, the average sizes of the matrix grain and precipitated phase increased from 180 and 580 nm to 415 and 942 nm, respectively. Precipitated phase size exhibited a strong linear relationship with the cube root of VHT time at a given temperature. Significantly larger precipitated phase sizes were observed at 1573 K compared to 1373 and 1473 K, indicating a degraded pinning effect and a reduction in the matrix grain growth exponent from 10 to 6. However, the matrix grain size remained in the submicron range due to inherent lattice distortion, sluggish diffusion, and precipitated phase pinning effects in high-entropy alloys. Consequently, excellent thermal stability of the microstructure was observed across various VHT conditions, resulting in a constant low-level hot deformation resistance in the studied alloy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.jallcom.2024.175977

However, current studies lack the assessment of the long-time corrosion performance of materials in service environments. In this paper, the corrosion behaviors of Zr35Ti30Nb20Al10Ta5 refractory high-entropy alloy (RHEA) immersed in 360 °C/18.6 MPa water and 400 °C/10.3 MPa steam for up to 400 days were investigated. The RHEA exhibited a faster early corrosion weight gain and slower late weight gain in both environments. The oxidation kinetic curves showed a near parabolic law. The RHEA formed a single oxide film with a thickness of ∼3.5 μm in the 360 °C water. In contrast, the oxide film in steam environment was a ∼10.1 μm bilayer structure. The oxide film in both environments were consisted of multiple oxides. A diffusion layer of Zr and Al depletion was present under the oxide film. The composition of the outer oxide layer in the steam environment was similar to that of the single oxide film in the 360 °C water. While the inner oxide film was mainly composed of oxides of Nb, Ta and Ti elements. The oxide film surface in the 360 °C water formed an AlO(OH) boehmite phase, which was shed during corrosion process. In the steam environment, the outer oxide layer surface retained the boehmite phase, gradually transforming into Al2O3 after long-time corrosion. © 2024",10.1016/j.mtcomm.2024.109392

The alloys were deliberately designed with different element concentrations and varied cooling rates after homogenization treatment, resulting in formation of multiple secondary phases. Microstructures of prepared alloys were reported, revealing the decomposition of the BCC matrix into dual-BCC phases with increasing V content. We attribute this phenomenon to the substantial atomic size misfit between V and Zr. Additionally, a metastable FCC phase and an intermetallic Laves phase emerged at intermediate temperatures in Nb0.75ZrTiV0.75, influenced by the nonequilibrium condition during cooling and the enthalpic effect. Compression tests were performed to access mechanical characteristics of different phases. The dual-BCC phases, featuring granular or multilayer morphology, enhanced ductility of the alloy by facilitating dislocation movement at BCC interfaces. In contrast, the FCC and Laves phases, characterized by a needle-like morphology, increased strength of the alloy owing to their intrinsic hardness. Based on the current discovery and understanding on secondary phases in the Nb–Zr–Ti–V alloys, our future objective is to obtain a modulated microstructure with an appropriate combination of different phases to optimize strength and ductility simultaneously. © 2024",10.1016/j.msea.2024.146954

They have also been connected to phase stability, as well as physical properties such as electrical conductivity. Experimental measurements of LLDs are, however, difficult and often ambiguous. Analysis of total scattering data in real space has been proposed to provide a uniquely suitable probe of LLDs, but its widespread application and validation are still limited. We conduct a thorough study of LLD measurements in refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) using small-box pair distribution function (PDF) analysis. We start by reexamining existing literature data using a recently proposed coherent theoretical framework to demonstrate that LLDs in RHEAs can indeed be considered as severe and can be reliably measured even in the absence of known thermal components. We perform total scattering experiments of a typical RHEA (HfNbTaTiZr) using both x-rays and neutrons, and show that real-space PDF analysis of data from different types of radiation gives consistent values of LLDs. The results are also in good agreement with the values derived from reciprocal-space data. Finally, through simulation and analysis of theoretical two-phase PDFs, we demonstrate that the effect of the chemical segregation in the investigated RHEA on the measured LLDs is limited when dealing with comparatively large LLDs. The results show that PDF analysis using small-box modeling provides a fast and reliable tool for measuring LLDs in RHEAs, which makes it ideal for analysis of large data sets from time-resolved in situ measurements.  © 2024 authors.

The analyses reveal two regimes in stress for all RMPEAs studied. In the low-stress regime, glide of the edge portions is smooth, and glide of the screw portions is jerky. In the high-stress regime, the edge to screw mobility ratio is approximately two and the edge mobility doubles from that in the low-stress regime. We also test a rapid density function theory-based method for generating energetic landscapes for large 3D crystals for simulation. As another key result, we find that dislocation mechanisms, velocities, and mobilities predicted between the two methods agree over a wide range of effective stresses, where the effective stress is the difference between the athermal lattice friction stress and the applied stress at 300 K. The second method is highly efficient, offering a way for performing dislocation dynamics quickly over a broad composition space. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.commatsci.2024.113280

For certain alloy systems, such as Mo–Ti–Cr–Al, both disordered (A2) and ordered (B2) crystal structures are possible. In this particular system, a solid-state transformation from A2 to B2 during cooling occurs. For Al concentrations above ≈10 at%, B2 order is obtained from the transformation temperature down to room temperature (RT), while A2 is stable above RT below the critical Al content. Herein, two alloys from the Mo–Ti–Cr–Al system close to the transition between A2 and B2 are investigated. Nanoindentation tests reveal that the magnitude of strain rate sensitivity for both alloys is small compared to classical alloys, however, significantly temperature dependent up to the strength plateau temperatures. The yield strength plateau, which is insensitive to the strain rate, is observed at temperatures exceeding 573 K. Modeling of solid solution strengthening reproduces the experimental data in the Al-lean A2 alloys. However, the observed discontinuous increase of strength in the Al-rich B2 alloys can only be rationalized by the appearance of B2 order and to no significant other obvious strengthening mechanisms. © 2024 The Authors.

Among these, high-entropy materials with refractory properties emerge as a new category for radiation shielding applications. This study introduces TiZrNbHfTa-TiZrNbHfTaOx composites tailored for such purposes. Initially, a TiZrNbHfTa refractory high-entropy alloy (RHEA) is synthesized via mechanical alloying, followed by the oxidation of the alloy to obtain its refractory high-entropy oxide (RHEO), TiZrNbHfTaOx. Composites are then prepared by blending 5%, 10%, and 20% weight fractions of RHEO with RHEA using mechanical alloying. Comparative analysis of shielding properties reveals a decrease in mass attenuation coefficient and effective atomic number with increasing RHEO content. While RHEA exhibits superior shielding performance against gamma photons and neutrons, the composite containing 20% RHEO emerges as the optimal shield against alpha and proton irradiations. The equivalent neutron dose rate and removal cross-section values are obtained 49.8% and 0.142 for the composite with 20% RHEO, respectively.

However, their lack of room temperature tensile ductility leads to cracks during processing and/or premature failure under mechanical loading when fabricated by laser-based metals additive manufacturing (AM). We present an alloy design framework for tensile ductility in non-equimolar RCCAs amenable to AM processing within the Ti–V–Cr–Nb–Zr–Ta system. First, density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning informed screening of alloy compositions were used to down-select ∼106 alloys with potential for tensile ductility. Next, Scheil solidification modeling was used to eliminate compositions most at risk for micro-segregation and solidification cracking based on the estimated freezing range of each alloy. This led to the design of two new, representative alloys: Ti0.4Zr0.4Nb0.1Ta0.1 and Ti0.486V0.375Ta0.028Cr0.111. These alloys were evaluated for rapid solidification defect formation using in-situ synchrotron melt pool imaging, fabricated via laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) AM, and then characterized for processing defects, microstructure, and mechanical properties. Overall, both alloys achieved tensile yield strengths >800 MPa and failure strains >5 %. However, the occurrence of un-melted powders of high melting point elements likely resulted in premature failure during tensile straining. Considerations about mitigating this defect source are discussed and the role of local micro-segregation on ductility are elucidated.

Some of these alloys demonstrated an excellent combination of high-temperature strength and room-temperature tensile ductility provided by the formation of a structure consisting of body-centred cubic (bcc) matrix and B2 nanodomains/particles. However, oxidation resistance and phase stability, and, more importantly, the resulting mechanical properties of the Al-containing RH/MEAs, which are critical characteristics for high-temperature structural materials, remain unexplored. Herein, these aspects were extensively investigated for the Al7.5(NbTiZr)92.5 (in at%) alloy having an initial bcc + B2 structure. The alloy was subjected to long-term (500 h) annealing or oxidation tests at 600, 700, and 800 °C followed by the evaluation of mechanical properties during uniaxial tension at 22 and 600 °C. Microstructural studies of the specimens exposed to long-term annealing showed the formation of Zr5Al3 particles that precipitated along the grain boundaries and within grain interiors. The volume fraction of these particles was the highest (∼16 %) after annealing at 600 °C and the lowest (∼0.5 %) after annealing at 800 °C. Oxidation tests revealed that the alloy was prone to pesting phenomena, which intensified with the temperature. The alloy could sustain pesting only up to 10 h at 600 °C, while it experienced a complete disintegration into powder after 5 h at 800 °C. The poor oxidation resistance originated from the formation of volumetric, non-protective (Al,Nb,Ti,Zr)O4 oxide. While insignificantly affecting the strength, long-term annealing or oxidation deteriorated the ductility of the Al7.5(NbTiZr)92.5 alloy both at 22 and 600 °C. The Zr5Al3 phase embrittled the alloy after long-term annealing at 600 or 700 °C, but marginally reduced the ductility in the 800°C-annealed specimens due to the low volume fraction and relatively homogeneous distribution of this phase. The oxidation for 1 h decreased the room-temperature ductility owing to the premature macroscopic localisation of plastic deformation induced by synergistic effects from the volumetric (Al,Nb,Ti,Zr)O4 oxide. This study highlights the necessity for the examination of a set of properties of promising RH/MEAs to critically assess perspectives of these alloys to find applications as new high-temperature materials in aircraft and aerospace sectors. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.msea.2024.146828

In the present work, both molecular statics (MS) and molecular dynamics (MD) methods are employed to investigate the interactions between 1/2<111> edge dislocations (EDs) and <100> irradiation dislocation loops (DLs) in typical BCC RHEAs of MoNbTaV and MoNbTaW. Two interatomic potentials, i.e., the embedded atom method (EAM) potential and the average atom potential, are adopted to assess the effect of RHEA lattice distortion on the ED-DL interactions. For the real random models simulated with the EAM potential, it is found that the EDs are prone to be partially pinned without fully interacting with the DLs due to the local lattice distortion, presumably leading to formation of loop complexes that consist of remained ED and DL segments as well as dislocations generated by reactions. In contrast, for the average models simulated with the average atom potential, which omit the lattice distortion, the DLs tend to be completely absorbed by EDs. The critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) calculation results show that the large lattice distortion of RHEAs can notably improve the anti-irradiation hardening performance. Furthermore, the effect of lattice distortion on DL-hindering-ED motion is closely related to the DL size. In order to incorporate the effects of both lattice distortion and DL-hindering, the dispersed barrier hardening (DBH) model is extended by introducing an amended length related to the RHEA type. The extended model can better capture the CRSS and associated irradiation hardening of BCC RHEAs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.jallcom.2024.175286

Coatings deposited at Ar pressure of 0.1–0.2 and 1.3–2.2 Pa had a dense, defect-free structure. Increasing the Ar pressure to 37–42 Pa led to the formation of a coating with a columnar structure, while, according to X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy, all coatings were amorphous. Increasing the Ar pressure from 0.1 to 0.2 to 37–42 Pa led to a magnifying the growth rate of coatings in 2.5 times. All coatings were characterized by a similar hardness of 14–15 GPa. The elastic modulus and elastic recovery decreased from 196 to 178 GPa and from 40 to 34 % when the argon pressure increased from 0.1 to 0.2 to 37–42 Pa, respectively. The coatings successfully resisted oxidation at temperatures of 1100 °C and 1300 °C. The protective properties of the coatings are due to the formation of a dense oxide film based on a-Si:B:O amorphous phase with crystallites of the m-HfO2, m-ZrO2, m-Nb2O3, o-Ta2O5, t-ZrSiO4 and t-HfSiO4 phases. Heating in a TEM column showed that the coating deposited at an Ar pressure of 0.1–0.2 Pa crystallizes immediately upon reaching a temperature of 700 °C with the release of predominantly the h-MoSi2 phase. Crystallization of the coating obtained at an Ar pressure of 37–42 Pa also occurs at 700 °C, but only during long-term exposure and is accompanied by the precipitation of the h-Ta5Si3 and t-Nb5Si3 phases. Thus, it has been shown that by increasing the gas flow rate, the productivity of sputtering in the HIPIMS mode can be increased without a significant loss in hardness, oxidation resistance and thermal stability of coatings. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.vacuum.2024.113456

Thus, a unique alloy design approach based on composition modification was used to improve these properties. Among the four constituent elements of the MoNbTaW alloy, Nb has good plasticity and lower density; hence a series of alloys with varying Nb content, namely Nbx(MoTaW)(1-x) with x = 0.4, 0.55, and 0.7 (designated as Nb0.4, Nb0.55, and Nb0.7 in this manuscript), were processed using vacuum arc melting. X-ray diffraction results showed that all the alloys formed as single-phase with the body-centered cubic crystal structure. The microstructures of these RMCAs are dendritic in nature with segregation of elements that decreased with heat treatment. The hardness values showed a decrease as the Nb content increased. The compressive yield strength values are 1251, 1055, and 945 MPa, and those of fractured strain are 10, 22, and 33 % for Nb0.4(MoTaW)0.6, Nb0.55(MoTaW)0.45, and Nb0.7(MoTaW)0.3 respectively. The increase in plastic strain and toughness is due to the increment in the Nb concentration, which is directly interpreted as an enhancement in degree of plasticity. The average grain sizes of Nb0.4, Nb0.55, and Nb0.7 RMCAs are measured to be 86 μm, 106 μm and 145 μm respectively. It was observed that 36 % of the grains are above 100 μm for Nb0.4 alloy, whereas this fraction is increased to 49 % and 60 % for Nb0.55 and Nb0.7 alloys respectively, which indicates an increase in average grain size as well as fraction of coarser grains as the Nb content increases. Hence, the improvement in plasticity is attributed to the increase in the average grain size and broader grain distribution. Fracture surface analysis of all the compositions showed quasi-cleavage behavior. This study demonstrates that increasing the Nb concentration in the MoNbTaW RMCA enhances plasticity while decreasing density. In comparison to conventional niobium alloys like C103 and FS-85, the alloys of the present study had higher yield strength at the temperatures where the tests were carried out. The specific yield strength values of these alloys are found to be higher than commercially available Nb alloys. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.intermet.2024.108379

In this study, we have investigated the effect of temperature and strain rate on the mechanical properties of single crystal equimolar NbTiZrMoV alloy, a refractory HEA (RHEA), using molecular dynamics simulation with the help of a newly developed modified embedded atom method (MEAM) potential. Uniaxial tensile simulations were conducted along x-direction at temperatures between 77 K and 600 K, with temperature intervals of 100 K, and at strain rates of 0.001 ps−1, 0.005 ps−1, 0.025 ps−1, and 0.125 ps−1. Stress-strain curves were plotted from the simulation data, and different tensile properties of the alloy were calculated from the graph. This study suggests that the tensile strength and the elastic modulus of the HEA decrease with increasing temperature as the materials become soft at higher temperatures. Strain rate improves the tensile mechanical properties with increasing rate due to the lack of required time for atom rearrangement and dislocation entrapment requiring higher stresses to continue deformation. Ultimately, the tensile characteristics of the HEA are shown to be influenced by the content of alloying elements.

Accurate prediction of phase constitution and modulation of phase stability over a broad temperature range is crucial to develop RHEAs with superior properties. In this study, thermodynamic and first-principles calculations were integrated to investigate the temperature-dependent phase constitution in the CrTaVW alloy system. The effect of V and W atoms occupation sites on the stability of TaCr2 Laves phase was evaluated. Both V or W atoms tend to occupy Cr sites in TaCr2, and V exhibits stronger alloying ability than W due to the reduced electronic density at the Fermi level. Moreover, with increasing the doping content, the V and W exhibit opposite influencing trends on the formation and structural stability of TaCr2 Laves phase. The Gibbs free energies of the Laves phase and solid solutions with variable compositions were obtained, enabling predictions for the critical temperatures of the phase transitions. The predicted behaviors of phase transitions were validated by experiments.

Nevertheless, the intricate microstructures of these materials impede uniform dissolution, resulting in suboptimal surface quality. In this work, based on a choline chloride-based deep eutectic solvent and suitable polarization parameters selected by linear scanning voltammetry, a split electrolytic cell (SEC) was proposed to alter the traditional integrated electrolytic cell (IEC) to enhance the anodic dissolution uniformity of dendritic-structured RHEAs. A much smoother surface with Ra of 0.233 μm and a smaller height discrepancy of 0.8 μm was obtained, compared to those processed in IEC at the same condition. The non-uniform anodic dissolution was mainly attributed to the cathode-forming (hydroxide ion (OH−), dissolution of tungsten (W) in the dendrite region under the attack by OH−, and the formation of by-product, i.e., the water molecule. The positive impact of SEC on dissolution uniformity could be ascribed to its role in inhibiting OH− from interacting with the anode, as well as to the enhancement of solution acidity on the anode side, which facilitated the dissolution of metal oxides. The suggested reaction pathway was subsequently validated through experiments with controlled water concentration and assessing of electrochemical kinetics. Finally, the effects of SEC under different parameters were demonstrated.

Ce was found to segregate at GBs and the most pronounced grain refinement effect in the 0.005Ce sample. With the Ce content increased from 0.005 at.% to 0.01 at.%, the Ce concentration at GBs increased from 0.12 at.% to ∼1.17 at.%, subsequently, inducing compositional fluctuation and facilitating transformation of BCC band (V-rich but Zr-poor) to ω-like phase with a non-close-packed hexagonal structure (NCPHS, V- and Zr-rich but Ti-poor) at GBs. The 0.005Ce alloy exhibited the optimized ductility (εf∼7.15%) and maintained yield strength of approximately 964 MPa at RT. The better balance of strength-ductility in the 0.005Ce alloy was resulted from synergistic deformation of multiple grains, high fraction (55.6%) of movable edge dislocations and abundant kink bands with the most slip systems. However, deteriorating ductility (εf∼2.29%) of the Nb0.5TiZrV0.5 alloy with 0.01 at.% Ce addition was mainly attributed to precipitation of the brittle ω-like phase at GBs.

In this work, we successfully achieved RT plasticization in a brittle (TaMoTi)92Al8 RHEA via in situ forming heterogeneous structure (HS) with the doping of Zr. Different from the mainstream design concept of “soft solid solution matrices with hard intermetallic phases” proposed in the literature, the newly developed TaMoZrTiAl RHEA is featured by a hard disordered BCC phase embedded into a soft intermetallic B2 matrix. Such an HS leads to the remarkable strength–plasticity synergy in this alloy at RT, showing a large plasticity of > 20 %, associated with a high strength of > 2380 MPa. It was found that solid solution strengthening and heterodeformation-induced strengthening caused by dislocation pile-ups at phase boundaries are responsible for the enhancement in the yield strength, while deformation-induced strain partition and the frequent operation of dislocation cross-slip substantially improve the work hardening capacity of alloy, thus enabling the high strength and good RT plasticity. In short, the current work not only reveals the micromechanisms of the influence of heterogeneous dual-phase structure on the RT mechanical behaviour in RHEAs but also provides a useful strategy for plasticizing brittle RHEAs. © 2024",10.1016/j.jmst.2024.01.022

Refractory multicomponent alloys with a BCC/B2 microstructure promise to serve as alternatives to the current state-of-the-art, Ni-based superalloys for applications at higher temperatures. With the vast compositional space of these alloys, the first fundamental question is whether the B2 phase can form among refractory metals. In this study, we span through the periodic table to investigate the potential for creating ordered B2 intermetallics among the refractory metals, using first principles calculations, and establish the correlation between the nature of the atomic bonds and stability of the B2 structure. We use our newly developed Multi-Cell Monte Carlo method to explore the extensive compositional space of these alloys, refine the trends in ordering, and pinpoint the most promising combinations for detailed analysis. We discover that B2 phases form exclusively with the inclusion of elements from groups VII and VIII, such as Re, Ru, and Os, and we identify these phases among a total of eleven elements. Further analysis of the electronic structure and bonding characteristics of these B2 systems reveals a pseudogap in the electronic density of states at the Fermi level. This pseudogap is attributed to the hybridization of d orbitals, leading to the formation of strong covalent bonds in the most stable compounds.

In this paper, we calculate the lattice thermal conductivity of the NbMoTaW RHEA using the equilibrium molecular dynamics method with a machine learning-based interatomic potential. We find that with increasing Mo concentration, the lattice thermal conductivity increased from 1.72 to 2.16 W/mK, an increase of 25.6%. The underlying mechanism is explained by the phonon density of states and phonon mode participation. Increasing the Mo concentration can induce a blueshift in both the low-frequency and high-frequency phonons. Moreover, we find that at the frequency corresponding to the phonon density of states peak, the NbMo1.5TaW RHEA has the largest mode participation rate, which is the main reason for the anomalous lattice thermal conductivity. In addition, we investigate the effect of temperature on the lattice thermal conductivity and the results show that anharmonicity has a dominant effect. Finally, the effect of compressive strain on the lattice thermal conductivity is explored.

Including a larger number of nearest-neighbor pair shells is in practice more effective in finding configurations corresponding to lower formation energies than considering many-body terms. In addition, we demonstrate the existence of weak-to-medium short-range chemical order for both equimolar compositions.

Data-driven methods offer promising solutions for overcoming such limitations for modeling segregation in such chemically complex environments (CCEs), and are employed in this study to understand segregation behavior of a refractory CCA, NbMoTaW. A flexible methodology is developed that uses composable computational modules, with different arrangements of these modules employed to obtain site availabilities at absolute zero and the corresponding density of states beyond the dilute limit, resulting in an extremely large dataset containing 10 million data points. The artificial neural network developed here can rely solely on descriptions of local atomic environments to predict behavior at the dilute limit with very small errors, while the addition of negative segregation instance classification allows any solute concentration from zero up to the equiatomic concentration for ternary or quaternary alloys to be modeled at room temperature. The machine learning model thus achieves a significant speed advantage over traditional atomistic simulations, being four orders of magnitude faster, while only experiencing a minimal reduction in accuracy. This efficiency presents a powerful tool for rapid microstructural and interfacial design in unseen domains. Scientifically, our approach reveals a transition in the segregation behavior of Mo from unfavorable in simple systems to favorable in complex environments.

According to our observation, increased Cr content promoted the formation of protective CrNbO4 and Cr2O3 oxides in NbTi + CrTa and NbTi + AlCrMo, enhancing oxidation resistance. The addition of Al resulted in the formation of AlTi-rich oxide in NbTi + AlTa. Ta addition resulted in the formation of complex oxides (MoTiTa8O25 and TiTaO4) and decreased oxidation resistance. Meanwhile, Mo’s low oxygen solubility could be beneficial for oxidation resistance while protective Cr2O3/CrNbO4 layers were formed. In NbTi + Ta, NbTi + AlTa and NbTi + CrTa, a considerable quantity of Ti-rich oxide was observed at the interdendritic region. In NbTi + AlCrMo, the enrichment of Cr and Ti at the interdendritic region could fasten the rate of oxidation.

The results show that all of the C/C composite joints contained two main phases: an equimolar (Ti-Zr-Hf-Ta)C hard phase and a near-pure Ni binder phase. The maximum indentation fracture toughness of the obtained joint reaction layer material was 15.52 ± 0.64 MPa·m1/2.

Calculations of physical parameters such as lattice constants, elastic modulus, hardness, yield strength, and dislocation energy factor indicate that adding elements with larger atomic radius and densities increases the lattice constants and density of the alloys. Adding more VB subgroup elements improves the elastic modulus, hardness, and strength of the alloy, with the TiHfNbTa alloy exhibiting the highest yield strength, approximately 1.28 GPa. The addition of the strongly metallic element Hf significantly enhances the Poisson's ratio and dislocation nucleation ability of the alloy, and its atomic bonds exhibit metallic bonding, which contributes to the improvement of the toughness of the alloy.

The experiment investigated the high-temperature creep mechanism of Ti-Ta-Nb-Mo-Zr RHEA prepared by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) technology. The high cooling rate of LPBF suppresses most of the elemental segregation, but there are still over-solidified precipitates and a few continuous precipitates (CP). In the range of 923–1023 K, the stress exponent and activation energy were determined to be 3.2–3.4 and 261.5 ± 19.5 kJ/mol, respectively. Compared with other conventional alloys and HEAs, a large reduction of the minimum creep rate is found in the LPBF-built Ti1.5Ta0.5NbZrMo0.5 RHEA, indicating a significant improvement in high-temperature properties. The dislocation tangles at the interface is formed during the creep process and new Zr-rich CP phases are generated in the dislocation tangles region. The interfacial dislocation tangles is the result of the interaction between dislocations and two-phase mismatch stresses. The dislocation tangles prevents dislocations from further cutting the matrix phase, which is very favorable to the high-temperature creep performance. At the same time, the formation of this dislocation tangles greatly accelerates the nucleation process and growth rate of the new CP phase.

There is a great need to classify the alloys in terms of brittle-ductile (B-D) properties, with easily obtainable ductility indices (DIs) ready to help design these refractory alloys. Usually, the DIs are checked by representing them as a function of fraction strain, ε. The critical values of DI and ε divide the DI—ε area into four squares. In the case of a successful DI, the points representing the alloys are located in the two diagonal opposite squares, well separating the alloys with (B-D) properties. However, due to the scatter of the data, the B-D separation is not perfect, and it is difficult to establish the critical value of DI. In this paper, we solve this problem by replacing the fracture strain parameter with new DIs that scale with the old DIs.

Remarkably, even at an elevated temperature of 700 °C, the CRRA sample maintains notable strength, displaying a yield strength of ∼695 MPa.

However, due to the vast compositional space of HEAs, efficiently discovering new HEAs with exceptional performance using trial-and-error methodology is time-consuming and challenging. In this work, a machine learning (ML) framework was introduced for Nb-Ti-V-Zr refractory HEA (RHEA) design. This framework aims to streamline the design of Nb-Ti-V-Zr RHEA with a focus on improving hardness. This framework encompasses data collection, feature construction, four-step feature selection, and training of different ML models, followed by Fisher material pattern recognition and SHAP feature analysis. For the first time, three key features, including the atomic size difference (δ), the configurational entropy of mixture (Smix), and the average deviation of electronegativity (AdE) were identified as the most significant compositional factors impacting the hardness of Nb-Ti-V-Zr RHEA. Furthermore, the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model with a polynomial kernel was the best-trained model for hardness prediction compared to other ML models trained and tested in this work. The coefficient of determination (R) was 0.85 for the testing set and 0.91 for 5-fold cross-validation, while the root mean square error (RMSE) values were 0.9 and 0.74, respectively. Moreover, it was observed that high-hardness samples follow a particular combination of key features, providing important optimization insights. Finally, the analysis of key features revealed the negative effect of AdE, the positive effect of Smix, and the hybrid effect of δ on hardness. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.mtcomm.2024.109607

The coated samples underwent 24-h aging heat treatment at temperatures of 600 °C, 800 °C, and 1000 °C, as well as laser remelting. The crystal structure, microstructure, microhardness, and wear resistance of each RHEA coating sample were comprehensively analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron backscattering diffraction (EBSD), Vickers hardness test, and general-purpose friction and wear test. The different effects of aging heat treatment and laser remelting treatment on the microstructure and properties of Mo0.5VNbTiCr0.25 RHEA coatings were investigated. The results showed that each group of RHEA coating samples had good metallurgical bonding with the substrate without obvious defects such as pores and cracks. The coated samples were mainly composed of body-centered cubic (BCC) phases and a small amount of hexagonal close-packed (HCP) phases. The mechanical properties of the laser remelted samples were the best, with a microhardness value of 526 HV0.2, and the best wear resistance.

Based on the concept of high-entropy alloys, five TiZr-based refractory multi-principal element alloys (RMPEAs), i.e. MoTiZr, NbTiZr, MoTiVZr, NbTiVZr, and NbMoTiZr were designed and their microstructure, mechanical properties, elastic properties, and biocompatibility were assessed in this study. Results indicate that NbTiZr and NbTiVZr RMPEAs are single-phase BCC alloys, while the other alloys exhibit multiphase structures. In terms of mechanical behaviors, NbMoTiZr RMPEA has the highest hardness (496±15 HV) among the five alloys and also combines a high yield strength and good ductility, with values of 1275 MPa and 21.66%, respectively. According to atomic calculations, the ideal shear strengths of the five alloys on the {110} plane are all lower than those on the {112} plane. Furthermore, NbMoTiZr RMPEA also exhibits a lower Young's modulus than that of Ti6Al4V, which can reduce “stress shielding” effects. The in vitro biocompatibility evaluation revealed that NbMoTiZr RMPEA can support cell adhesion and proliferation of MC3T3-E1 cells and exhibits good biocompatibility comparable to Ti6Al4V.

The additions of Fe, Mn, or Fe and Mn (at the expense of Cr) retained the density below 4 g/cm3 and resulted in forming a D8a phase (Th6Mn23-prototype; cF120; Fm-3m) in all the alloys, except for the Al55Cr18Ti22Mn5 alloy. The D8a phase nucleated with a different morphology within or adjacent to the C11b phase, and adopted an orientation relationship of (110)C11b || (4‾4‾ 0)D8a, [3 3‾ 1]C11b || [1‾ 11‾]D8a, which provided coherent C11b/D8a interfaces. Alloying with Mn or Fe and Mn had either neutral or negative effect on the mechanical properties, while the Fe additions boosted the strength along with some decrease in the compressive plasticity at room temperature. Specifically, the Al55Cr13Ti22Fe10 alloy showed a yield strength of 250 MPa at 1000°С, which was 60 % higher compared to the Al55Cr23Ti22 alloy. During plastic deformation, all the alloys demonstrated pronounced strain hardening at T ≤ 800 °C and steady state flow at 1000 °C. Post-deformation observation of the microstructure of the Al55Cr13Ti22Fe10 alloy showed the inhomogeneous distribution of the strain-induced defects between the L12 matrix and (C11b + D8a) regions at 800 °C and partial recrystallisation of these phases at 1000 °C. All the alloys exhibited complex oxidation behaviour with multistage oxidation kinetics. The addition of 5 at% of Fe or Mn was beneficial for the oxidation resistance, while the further increase in their contents intensified the mass gain after a certain time. The latter effect was more pronounced in the Al55Cr13Ti22Mn10 alloy than in the Al55Cr13Ti22Fe10 alloy, because of forming a loose Al2O3 oxide layer.

The microstructure exhibited a typical dendritic pattern, consisting of BCC dendrites and Cr-rich Laves interdendrites. The area fraction of the Cr-rich Laves phase increased from 5% to 28% with the increase in Cr content. This increase led to elevated yield strength values, rising from 1100 ± 20 MPa to 1330 ± 30 MPa. The primary mechanisms contributing to the mechanical properties were solid-solution strengthening from the BCC phase and the formation of a small amount of hard Laves phase. These mechanisms, combined with the low density of the alloys, resulted in an excellent combination of specific yield strength and plasticity in the Cr0.1V0.5Nb0.5ZrTi alloy.

This study prepared fine-grained HfMoNbTaTi refractory high-entropy alloys using a powder metallurgy process combining mechanical alloying (MA) and spark plasma sintering (SPS). This method effectively addresses the issue of room temperature brittleness and achieves a favorable balance between strength and plasticity. The resulting sintered alloy comprises two body-centered cubic (BCC) solid solution matrices and a range of nanoprecipitates, including the γ-phase, σ-phase, and α-phase. With increasing sintering temperature, the average grain size increased from 0.45 μm (at 1400 °C) to 4.56 μm (at 1700 °C). Simultaneously, the content of the γ-phase gradually decreases due to the greater influence of mixing entropy. Under quasi-static loading, the fine-grained multiphase structure not only benefits from grain boundary strengthening and precipitation strengthening effects, but also enhances the deformation uniformity, ultimately improving both the strength and plasticity. At 1450 °C, the sintered alloy exhibited a compressive yield strength of 2325 ± 8.40 MPa and a plastic strain of 26.44 ± 1.17 %. These values represent a 35.73 % increase in yield strength and a 120.33 % increase in plastic strain compared to those of the as-cast alloy. The deformation process at room temperature is mainly governed by the multiplication of screw dislocations and cross-slips. In the middle and late stages of deformation, the grains exhibit a preferred orientation, further enhancing the plastic strain.

These features are proven to effectively incorporate material knowledge into ML modeling. They also offer potential alternatives to those obtained from costly first-principles calculations. Based on Pearson correlation coefficients, the linear relationships between pairwise features were compared, and the seven key features with the greatest impact on the model were selected for ML modeling. Regression tasks were performed to predict the ductility of TiZrNbVAl, and the CatBoost gradient boosting algorithm exhibiting the best performance was eventually selected.

In this study, we proposed a novel AlxHfTaTi body-centered cubic (BCC) refractory medium entropy alloy with remarkable strength-ductility combination at room temperature. Adjusting the atomic ratio of Al (from 0 to 0.5 at.%), we investigated the effect of Al on the structure-property characteristics of the alloy under as-cast as well as cold-rolled and annealed conditions. Compared with the as-cast samples, the rolled and annealed samples exhibit more excellent tensile properties due to the remarkable reduction of grain size resulted from recrystallization. The Al0.3HfTaTi sample annealed for 5 min exhibits outstanding comprehensive properties at room temperature, with a yield strength higher than 1000 MPa and a fracture elongation of up to 24 ± 1 %, respectively.

Generally, its strengthening mechanism mainly comes from solid solution strengthening caused by atomic radius mismatches, but excessive atomic radius mismatch can reduce the phase stability of solid solution and easily generate precipitated phases to reduce the plasticity. Here, we present a strategy to enhance the shear modulus mismatch while improving the mechanical properties and phase stability of LRHEAs. We chose the TiZrVNbAl system as the LRHEAs model. The addition of Mo resulted in a modulus mismatch induced strength contribution of 564 MPa, which accounts for ∼57 % of the total strength. Compared to the alloy without Mo, the strength increased by ∼42 % without any loss of ductility. More importantly, the addition of Mo significantly reduces the diffusion coefficient of the main element and realizes the effective kinetic suppression of the precipitated phase. This enables the alloy to avoid brittle precipitate generation even after aging at 500 °C for 5 h, and hence the excellent mechanical properties are well kept. Additionally, the strength of the LRHEA is increased by more than two times at 700 °C, demonstrating higher high temperature performance compared to RHEAs with tensile ductility. Utilizing the shear modulus mismatch strategy can effectively enhance the solid solution strengthening effect, improving the comprehensive mechanical properties of the alloy at room temperature and high temperature, while also improving phase stability.

We validated thermal conductivity predictions on elemental solids, binary and ternary alloys, and RHEAs and compared them against thermodynamic (CALPHAD) predictions and our experiments with good correlations. To understand observed trends in thermal conductivity, we assessed the phase stability, electronic structure, phonon, and intrinsic- and tensile strength of down-selected RHEAs. Our electronic structure and phonon results connect well with the observed compositional trends for thermal transport in RHEAs.

However, their application is inhibited by insufficient strength at elevated temperatures and brittleness at ambient temperatures. Herein, we proposed a multiscale oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) NbTaTiV RHEA with an excellent combination of strength and plasticity at both room and elevated temperatures. The multilevel microstructures are composed of a fine-grained BCC phase matrix (∼1.2 μm), submicron Ti-(O, N) particles (∼330 nm), and nanoscale Y2Ti2O7 particles (∼18 nm). Owing to the strengthening of combinatorial multilevel microstructures, the yield strength of the RHEA was found as high as 1626 MPa, which exhibits a significant improvement (∼46%) in comparison with the NbTaTiV RHEA, without significant loss of ductility. The ODS NbTaTiV RHEA also shows superior thermal-softening resistance, with yield strengths of 945 MPa at 700 °C and 482 MPa at 1000 °C. The enhanced strength is mainly attributed to the multilevel microstructures that mediate the collaborative strengthening mechanism among dispersed strengthening, precipitation strengthening, and grain boundary strengthening.

The in vitro experiments proved that RHEA nanofilm had the highest Ecorr (−0.127 V), with the Icorr value was two orders of magnitude lower than substrate. Its osteoblast proliferative capacity was 1.5 times higher than substrate (after culturing for 5 days), and the collagen secretion and extracellular matrix mineralization reached an optimal level, showing excellent osteogenic activity.

The mechanical properties of the samples were evaluated through microhardness testing, while their corrosion performance was assessed by potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements. The study investigated the effects of different nitrogen contents on the microstructure, mechanical properties, and corrosion resistance of the BCC-structured W-Ta-Cr-V alloy in the past tense. The study found that the doping of an appropriate amount of nitrogen can lead to the formation of FCC and HCP structured nitrides. As the nitrogen content increases, there is a significant change in the preferred orientation of the coating. When the nitrogen content is 16.6 at.%, the distribution of the nitrides is uneven, resulting in increased surface undulations and roughness. Conversely, when the nitrogen content is elevated to 48.1 at.%, the clustering of surface nitride particles becomes more pronounced, leading to a decrease in the coating density. The thickness of the nitride coatings is around 10 μm, with a slight decrease in thickness as the nitrogen content increases. The hardness of the coatings is significantly superior to that of the W-Ta-Cr-V alloy films, reaching up to 3465 HV0.25 in the highest instance.

Equiatomic MEA had primarily bcc with minor hcp phases where the single bcc was achieved with the addition of Nb. The single bcc Nb rich alloy resulted in 13 % elongation, much higher than equiatomic or Ti rich alloy. All the MEAs showed comparatively higher yield strength due to the climb of edge dislocations which is the main rate limiting mechanism at 300 K, as evident molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The locally fluctuating energy landscape promotes kinks on edge dislocation, and at local minima nanoscale segments gets pinned. Upon yielding the entangled kink leaves a trail of vacancies/interstitials and escapes via climb motion to render high yield strength. The higher corrosion and pitting resistance of Nb enriched alloys can be attributed to the stable ZrO2, Nb2O5, TiO2, and MoO3 oxides, high polarization resistance (106–105 Ωcm−2), and low defect densities (1016–1018).

Here, we discovered that the introduction of multicomponent ceramic nanoparticles (MCNPs) into the RHEAs makes the problem alleviative and realizes a multifold increase in plasticity without sacrificing strength. The detailed characterizations show that the improvement originates from the chemical ordering-disordering transition near MCNPs in the B2-ordered RHEAs. This transition promotes the formation of local disordered regions where the mobility of dislocations is significantly enhanced. These regions wrap around MCNPs to form a unique heterogeneous structure, which suppresses the premature microcracks by the boosted dislocation mobility.

The small grain size with a high density of grain boundaries causes higher levels of shear strain and residual stress compared to specimens with larger grain sizes. Furthermore, the grain boundary acts as a barrier that resists the movement of dislocations in larger grains, enhancing hardness, while smaller grains demonstrate predominant grain rotation, reducing hardness. The highest elastic recovery in a sample with a grain size of 97.82 Å is related to the smallest dislocation length, while larger dislocation lengths in specimens with grain sizes of 73.75 Å and 141.07 Å result in lower recovery capabilities. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.ijrmhm.2024.106769

However, the early onset of plastic instability in RHEAs is a critical issue to be addressed. In this study, a novel Zr35Ti30Nb20Al10V5 RHEA was subjected to 95% cold rolling and annealing, achieving outstanding mechanical properties. Notably, the cold-rolled alloy exhibited the highest reported tensile strength (∼2.0 GPa) among RHEAs with a moderate ductility of ∼8.5%. Moreover, Additionally, the subsequent annealing process enabled the alloy to achieve an outstanding combination of yield strength (1.1 GPa) and fracture elongation (20%). The cold-rolled alloy has a heterogeneous lamella structure with high-density dislocation cells and dislocation pile-ups, and lattice distortion in the locally chemically ordered structure. The high work hardening behavior originates from the heterogeneous deformation-induced (HDI) hardening, which makes the HDI stress and hardening rate increase with increasing strain. In the annealed alloy, lattice distortion increases significantly with increasing strain, promoting dislocation cross-slip. The dislocation pile-ups and interactions facilitate the transition of microbands, and the relatively stable work-hardening behavior of the alloy is mainly attributed to the microband-induced plasticity effect.

The DFT calculations demonstrated the excellence of specific non-equimolar compositional spaces. It was found that stoichiometries rich in W and poor in V are exceptionally hard, while those rich in V and poor in W demonstrate unprecedented toughness, as determined by the ductility descriptor (Pugh's Ratio). The computational analysis shows the significance of microstructures that contain both (W-rich and W-poor) solid solution, where a synergy between hardness and toughness is created. Our experimental synthesis using vacuum arc melting demonstrated the possibility of successfully producing these alloys with W-rich (dendritic) and W-poor (interdendritic) solid solution regions, starting from elemental powders. The introduction of chromium (Cr) resulted in enhanced microhardness and wear resistance. The peak microhardness was attained when 0.5 moles of Cr were added, reaching 7.03 ±0.24 GPa, accompanied by the least wear volume loss.

Deuterium and helium retention and desorption behavior induced by deuterium and helium plasma exposure of the two films were investigated. The total deuterium retention measured by thermal desorption spectra (TDS) in the HEA film was approximately 16 times larger than that in the W film, which was attributed to the existence of more grain boundary defects and vacancy-type defects in HEA film, leading to more deuterium trapped.

The composite is found to be composed of two ultrafine-grained (UFG) phases including a body-centered cubic (bcc) solid-solution phase and a face-centered cubic (fcc) ceramic reinforcement phase (Ti, Nb)C. The as-sintered composite shows a uniform and UFG microstructure where two phases are interconnected.

The outstanding high-temperature compressive strength was found to be associated with high resistance to dislocation motion and strong dislocation interactions in both the bcc and fcc phases. The phase interface after hot compression remained semi-coherent, vindicating its high stability. The high-density of stable phase interfaces not only retards the dislocation motion due to the large image force near the phase boundary but also induces a high value of activation energy for diffusion. The high activation energy can further achieve significant microstructure stability even after a long-term annealing (36 h) at 1000 °C.

The carbides and BCC matrix exhibit synergistic strengthening behavior.

Here, the microstructures and mechanical properties of N-free and N-doped Ti2ZrNbV0.5Mo0.2 HEAs before and after He irradiation were investigated. The results showed that the solid solution strengthening caused by interstitial N improved the yield strength at room temperature and 1023 K without significantly reducing plasticity. N doping significantly promoted the growth, aggregation and wider spatial distribution of He bubbles by enhancing the mobility of He atoms/He-vacancy complexes, with the average size of He bubbles increasing from 10.4 nm in N-free HEA to 31.0 nm in N-doped HEA. In addition, N-doped HEA showed a much higher irradiation hardness increment and hardening fraction than N-free HEA. Contrary to conventional materials doped with N, the introduction of N into Ti2ZrNbV0.5Mo0.2 HEA had adverse effects on its resistance to He bubble growth and irradiation hardening.

Herein, curved MoS2 nanosheets are periodically introduced into the TiNbMoTaCr film for triggering the self-assembly mixed metal oxides @MoS2 nanoscrolls, which contain hard mixed metal oxides cores and the low-shearing lubricant MoS2 shells, during the friction in the air environment; such mixed metal oxides@MoS2 nanoscrolls in the friction interfaces can contribute to the robust low friction and low wear. Compared to the pure TiNbMoTaCr film (with high COF of ∼0.78, low abrasive durability identified by worn-out event), the periodic incorporation of 10 nm thickness curved MoS2 sheets can successfully achieve a low COF of ∼0.08 and low wear rate of ∼9.561 × 10-8 mm3/ Nm, much lower than the pure MoS2 film (COF = ∼ 0.21, wear rate = ∼ 1.03 × 10-6 mm3/ Nm). Such superior tribological properties originate from the cooperative interaction of TiNbMoTaCr nanolayers and curved MoS2 nanosheets, accompanied by the self-assembly of mixed metal oxides@MoS2 nanoscrolls. In these nanoscrolls, TiNbMoTaCr can act as an ‘air-absorbing agent’ to form high-loading mixed metal oxide cores and serve as an ‘oxygen sacrificer,’ preventing the low-shearing lubricant curved MoS2 nanosheets from oxidation. In addition, even with the soft MoS2, the hardness of the TiNbMoTaCr/MoS2 nanomultilayers can still be well maintained and increased above the calculated values by mixing law, further favoring superior mechanical durability. The synergetic effect of TiNbMoTaCr and curved MoS2 nanosheets during the friction in air can provide a route to design HEA films with enhanced tribological properties for better mechanical durability and broader application prospects. © 2024 American Chemical Society.",10.1021/acsami.3c18085

We determined that the as-cast microstructure of the non-equiatomic V14Nb19Mo20Ta24W23 and V22Nb24Mo24Ta24W10 alloys consist of two BCC phases with different lattice constants, and that the equiatomic alloy of the V-Nb-Mo-Ta-W system consists of two BCC phases with different compositions but the same lattice constants. The two BCC phases form lattice-matched interfaces, suggesting that precipitation-hardening with high lattice-matching can be one of the reasons for the excellent high-temperature mechanical properties of this alloy system.

While the hardness of the alloy increased from about ~ 352 HV to ~ 430 HV, the tensile ductility decreased significantly. The main reason for the increase in hardness is the strong bonding between aluminum atoms and other atoms.

However, its limited room-temperature plasticity has greatly hindered its engineering application. To obtain an excellent strength-plasticity matching relationship, in this reported study, the Ta content in the high-entropy alloy (HEA) was adjusted to rectify this shortcoming. A series of TiZrTaxNbMo (x = 1.0, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, and 0.6 at. percent, at%) RHEAs were prepared using the vacuum arc-melting technique, and the microstructure and mechanical properties of these RHEA alloys were systematically investigated. The experimental results show that the TiZrTaxNbMo RHEAs are composed of main BCC1 and minor BCC2 phases, which exhibit a dendritic structure. By reducing the Ta content, the elemental segregation caused by the non-equilibrium solidification is reduced. In terms of mechanical properties, with the decrease of Ta content, the hardness and room-temperature yield strength of the alloy decreases slightly, but the room-temperature plasticity increases significantly. The Ta0.7 alloy has the highest plasticity (34.8 %), which is about twice that of the equimolar Ta 1.0 alloy, while the yield strength remained at 1297 MPa. The excellent mechanical properties of the alloys can be attributed to solid-solution strengthening and the formation of moderate amounts of interdendritic regions. The interaction between slip bands and dislocations formed during compression of the Ta0.7 alloy decreased its work hardening.

These alloys have the potential to replace traditional alloys by providing a range of tailored mechanical properties, corrosion resistance, and radiation tolerance, all achievable through complex compositions. This study utilizes various machine learning (ML) techniques to predict phases of MPEAs based on two data sets, incorporating statistical measures and interactions of features. The first dataset consisted of 3D transition MPEAs, while in the second dataset, the 3D transition MPEAs alloyed with refractory elements were added to the first dataset. Valence electron concentration, mixing enthalpy, mixing entropy, melting temperature, and electronegativity were the most important features, with phase detection accuracy ranging between 68.0% to 97.7%. Next, to predict the mechanical properties, we developed a novel two-layered Bayesian shrinkage method to stack the prediction power and model-based clustering of Support Vector Machine Regression (SVMreg), Random Forest Regression (RFreg) and a Mixture of Linear Regression with Experts. This was done to predict the mechanical properties of MPEAs more accurately, including microhardness, ultimate and yield strength, elastic modulus, and elongation. The proposed Bayesian machine deals with the multicollinearity of the base predictive models and shrinks the predictions to find the optimum predictive candidates. The proposed Bayesian method outperforms the base ML methods in predicting the mechanical properties of MPEAs.

The microhardness, compression properties, and nanoindentation creep properties of AlxCr0.2NbTiV alloys were also tested. The results show that the AlxCr0.2NbTiV series exhibits a BCC single-phase structure. As the Al content increases, the lattice constant of the alloys gradually decreases, and the intensity of the (110) crystal plane diffraction peak increases. Adding aluminum enhances the effect of solution strengthening; however, due to grain coarsening, the microhardness and room temperature compressive strength of the alloy are only slightly improved. Additionally, because the effect of solution strengthening is diminished at high temperatures, the compressive strength of the alloy at 1000 °C is significantly reduced. The creep mechanism of the alloys is predominantly governed by dislocation creep. Moreover, increasing the Al content helps to reduce the sensitivity of the alloy to the loading rate during the creep process.

However, the creep behaviors of NC RHEAs, which must be well evaluated for high-temperature applications, are largely unknown because it is difficult to produce bulk quantities of NC RHEAs for creep tests. In the present work, an equiatomic bulk NC VNbMoTaW RHEA with an average grain size of 67 ± 17 nm was synthesized by mechanical alloying (MA) and the subsequent high-pressure/high-temperature sintering. The creep tests were performed on bulk specimens by compression at high temperatures (973 and 1073 K) under different stresses (70–1100 MPa).

The derived activation volume, stress exponent, and activation energy of bulk NC VNbMoTaW indicate that the creep deformation is dominated by grain boundary diffusion. The creep deformation is controlled by the diffusion of Mo and Nb elements, which have the two slowest grain boundary diffusivities among the five alloying elements.

The tribological properties of TiMoCrWxTay coatings at 800 °C are better than those at room temperature. TiMoCrWxTay RHEA coatings follow near-linear oxidation kinetics during the oxidation of 50 h at 800 °C.The oxidation resistance of the coatings first increases and then decreases with the increase of Ta content. Ta2O5, TiO2 and other oxides may have a shielding effect on the oxidation of W. In particular, The W0.3Ta0.5 shows the best tribological properties and oxidation resistance, and the mass gain of W0.3Ta0.5 is only 13.4 mg/cm2 after the oxidation test for 50 h. It indicates that TiMoCrWxTay coatings can obtain good high temperature performance by optimizing the content of W and Ta in RHEA coatings. This work can provide guidance for the research and application of TiMoCrWxTay RHEA coatings. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.surfcoat.2024.130969

High entropy alloys (HEAs) have sparked worldwide attention to develop novel alloys composed of equiatomic quinary elements (Ni–Ti–Al–Li–Si) to develop lightweight material, viz. mechanical alloying (MA) technique. MA technique is applied to synthesize the newly designed composition HEA (ball-milling process carried out at 0, 1, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 h). The developed alloy is subjected to various characterizations such as X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, differential scanning calorimeter, and thermogravimetric analysis. The alloy confirms the face-centered cubic crystal structure with lattice parameter a = 3.5 A° at 50 h of ball milling, and elemental mapping confirms the presence of all elements. HEA in a ball-milled state confirms the nano-crystallite size of 11.5 nm with a percent lattice strain equal to 0.6089. Thermal studies clearly show the developed alloy is stable without any phase transformation. The 50 h of ball milled Ni–Ti–Al–Li–Si alloy powder is subjected to hot compaction at 850 °C for 1 h duration. The developed alloy was tested for density examination, which resulted in an average value of 3.5 ± 0.06 g/cm3, which is in good agreement with a theoretical density of 3.7 g/cm3. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature 2022.

Additive manufacturing with its complex shape forming and flexible design abilities, can intensively meet the future industrial requirements. However, the additively manufactured WMoTaNb RHEA is restricted by room-temperature brittleness before entering the market. Therefore, we newly developed a WMoTaNbNiTi RHEA, and it has been discovered that Ni, Ti, and Nb at the grain boundaries mainly formed the NiTi B19’ phase, thus sharing the residual stresses with the BCC matrix. The ductility of the as-built WMoTaNbNiTi RHEA at room temperature has thus been considerably improved. In addition, an ultimate compressive strength of 738 MPa at 1200 °C was also realized.

Their practical application is hindered by ambient brittleness and inferior formability. Titanium (Ti) is recognized as a crucial element in improving the ductility and oxidation resistance of RHEAs, but its plasticizing mechanism is still unclear. To address this, a series of body-centered cubic (BCC) single-phase VNbTaTix alloys were designed. The alloys exhibited exceptional ductility and cold-rolling formability at room temperature. Remarkably, the tensile fracture elongation of VNbTaTi alloy was about 26.9%, which surpassed most RHEAs. The major plastic mechanisms of the alloys are a/2<1 1 1>-type dislocation and {1 1 2}<1 1 1>-type twinning. Solid solution strengthening was identified as the primary strengthening mechanism. Although Ti reduced the solid solution strengthening effect, it contributed to weight reduction and enhanced local lattice distortion. This study not only designed several RHEAs with ductility but also provided insights into the effect of Ti content on their phase stability, lattice distortion, and strength mechanisms.

In this paper, novel NbMoZrTi-X (Al, V) light refractory high entropy alloys (LRHEAs) were fabricated and their physical phase composition, microstructure, hardness, and wear and corrosion resistance were systematically investigated. The results show that NbMoZrTi LRHEA and NbMoZrTiV LRHEA are both single BCC structures, while NbMoZrTiAl LRHEA and NbMoZrTiAlV LRHEA are transformed into BCC, B2, and Zr5Al3 phase structures. The hardness increases as the volume fraction of the Zr5Al3 hard phase increases, with NbMoZrTiAl LRHEA having a maximum Vickers hardness of 811.29 HV. Room temperature dry friction tests showed that NbMoZrTiAl LRHEA had the lowest wear and coefficient of friction of 1.5 mg and 0.6713, respectively. Electrochemical tests performed in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution showed that NbMoZrTiAlV LRHEA has excellent corrosion resistance with the highest Ecorr (−0.142 V) and the lowest Icorr (2.149 × 10−7 A/cm2). Therefore, the addition of V and Al to NbMoZrTi-based LRHEA can effectively improve its wear and corrosion resistance due to the increase in hardness and dense passivation film formation.

Understanding dislocation mobility is vital for optimizing high-temperature properties and ambient temperature ductility of RHEAs. Nevertheless, fundamental questions persist regarding the variability of dislocation motion in the rugged energy landscape and the effective activation barrier for specific mechanisms, such as kink-pair nucleation and kink migration. Here we perform systematic atomistic simulations and conduct statistical analysis to obtain the effective activation barriers for the mechanisms underlying various types of dislocation motion in a typical RHEA, NbMoTaW. Moreover, a stochastic line tension model is developed to calculate the activation barrier with substantially reduced computational costs. By incorporating the effective activation barriers into the crystal plasticity model, a multiscale simulation framework for predicting the mechanical properties of RHEAs is established. The ambient temperature yield strength of NbMoTaW is well-predicted by the kink-pair nucleation mechanism of screw dislocations, while the strengthening originating from screw dislocations does not predominate at high temperatures.

Specifically, the modes of plasticity active in the B2 matrix and in an alloyed version of the phase Al4Zr5 found at grain and subgrain boundaries were explored by use of nano-indentation. For the B2 phase, a combination of weak-beam dark-field and superlattice imaging revealed dissociation of 〈111〉 superdislocations into two superpartial dislocations, bounding an anti-phase boundary (APB), following the reaction: a〈111〉= a/2〈111〉+APB+a/2〈111〉. The dislocations in the B2 phase exhibited long, relatively straight screw segments and short edge segments, such that the mobility of the edge dislocations appears to be higher than that of the screw segments. Evidence of a B2 to bcc slip transmission process has been observed through use of stereo-pair imaging and anaglyph construction. This process involves the transmission of slip from the B2 matrix, followed by the decorrelated motion of the two a/2〈111〉 dislocations in the bcc precipitate, demonstrated by the increased separation of the dislocations within the bcc phase. Regarding the deformation of the Al4Zr5 intermetallic phase, it was found that indentation of this phase resulted in no evidence of dislocation generation and motion, and cracking at the edges of the given indent. It has been concluded that the lack of plasticity of this phase is the cause of the room temperature brittle nature of this alloy. © 2024",10.1016/j.actamat.2024.119824

As the Mo content increases from 0 at.% to 7 at.%, the yield strength of RHEAs increases from 670 MPa to 975 MPa at room temperature. The high strength of the BCC RHEAs mainly depends on solid-solution strengthening caused by the Mo addition. The RHEAs with low Mo content (0–5 at.%) can possess high tensile plasticity of ∼20 %, while it reflects brittle after the 7 at.% Mo addition. The high tensile plasticity of the RHEAs was attributed to the combined effects of lattice rotation to promote and refine crystalline strengthening. The RHEAs with 5 at.% Mo addition have high specific yield strength (∼32 MPa g−1cm3) and excellent fracture strains (＞60 %) at 1173 K.

In this work, a series of NbTiVxZr high-entropy alloys (HEAs) with low density were formulated to explore the evolution of microstructures and mechanical properties with varying vanadium content. When the vanadium content was low, the matrix exhibited the single-phase body-centered cubic structure. Excessive vanadium contents (NbTiV0.75Zr, NbTiVZr) disrupted phase stability and tended to aggregate at grain boundaries, forming V-rich and Zr-rich phases. These precipitated phases pinned grain boundaries, impeding grain growth and resulting in both grain boundary strengthening and precipitation strengthening, albeit at the expense of grain boundary cohesion, ultimately leading to brittleness. However, these deleterious phases were redissolved, and fracture elongation increased more than 2 times after water quenching at 1200 °C. The microstructural changes induced by heat treatment were corroborated by alterations in grain boundary relaxation behavior, where the redissolution of precipitated phases after water quenching caused a shift of the grain boundary relaxation internal friction peak to a lower temperature and an increase in peak height.

Crystallite size decreased as milling progressed, yielding average sizes of approximately 7.2 nm, 7.4 nm, and 9.7 nm, with lattice strains of 1.143%, 1.148%, and 1.15%, respectively. Both experimental and calculated values of lattice parameters converged to around 3.1685 ± 0.002 and 3.1791 ± 0.010 Å for all three alloys. The synergy of Cr and W in TiMoNb was observed for the first time, impacting dislocation density, hardness, and oxidation stability. TiMoNbCrW exhibited reduced dislocation density and the highest hardness (502 HV). TGA indicated enhanced oxidation resistance up to 400 °C for TiMoNbCrW compared to the most vulnerable TiMoNbCr alloy. © The Indian Institute of Metals - IIM 2024.",10.1007/s12666-023-03259-8

The mechanical properties and thermal stability of RHEAs are primarily attributed to the solid solution phase, which is essentially the body-centered cubic (BCC) phase. The BCC phase formation rules thus became the basic criterion in the compositional design of RHEAs. In this paper, the BCC phase formation rules in cobalt-free RHEAs were determined via the calculation of six semiempirical parameters, namely, the entropy of mixing, enthalpy of mixing, atomic size difference, Ω-parameter, d-orbital energy level and valance electron concentration. The mixing enthalpy and atomic size differences are more effective than other semiempirical parameters for predicting BCC phase stability in cobalt-free RHEAs. The presence of aluminum is found to cause a notable alteration in the range of phase stability in cobalt-free RHEAs. © 2024 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.rinp.2024.107688

The two methods comprises conventional arc (button) melting and a powder route based on mechanical alloying and consolidation via severe plastic deformation. In particular, blended elemental powder is pre-compacted and subjected to one or four passes of equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) at 500 °C and then 10 revolutions of high pressure torsion (HPT) at room temperature to an effective strain between 4 and 40. Some samples are then annealed at 500 °C for 1 h to investigate the thermal stability of the phases. The four ECAP passes at 500 °C do not result in the formation of the body-centered cubic (BCC) phase typical for the program RHEAs despite the presence of interfacial zones between particles and defect-driven diffusion. Nevertheless, a single ECAP pass is sufficient to create a solid bulk sample for subsequent HPT. After 10 HPT revolutions, in contrast to melting route resulting in a single BCC phase alloy, both alloys form new phases comprising a Nb-rich BCC phase and a ZrHf-rich HCP phase in both alloys. © 2024 The Authors.

High interstitial content, inhomogeneous microstructures, fractured and hollow particles, and the presence of microsegregation, led to embrittlement, and in case of cold spray, the wide particle size range of the feedstock resulted in undesired flowability, adversely affecting the processibility of the developed material.

The strengthening mechanisms in ZrNbMoTaW body centered cubic RHEA prepared via femtosecond laser fabricating are discussed comprehensively. By analyzing the mechanical properties of femtosecond laser fabricated ZrNbMoTaW RHEAs with different processing parameters, the optimal femtosecond laser fabricating window of ZrNbMoTaW RHEAs with enhanced microhardness and low porosity was obtained. The grain morphology, phase structure, elemental distribution, local misorientation and lattice parameters of ZrNbMoTaW RHEA at optimized processing parameters were investigated. The instantaneous fabricating temperature was measured to analyze the effect of femtosecond laser on powder melting. The results show that the microstructure of ZrNbMoTaW RHEA consists of homogeneous BCC1 and BCC2 phase distribution with refined grains (sizeave = 2.1 μm). Based on the numerical deduction of RHEA with enhanced hardness, contributions to the multiple strengthening mechanisms are given to establish the relationship between the microstructure and hardness of femtosecond laser fabricating ZrNbMoTaW RHEAs, including frictional stress (16.4%), dislocation hardening (17.9%), grain boundary strengthening (9.9%) and solid solution strengthening (55.8%), respectively. Adequate solid solution effect, high dislocation density and low grain size endow ZrNbMoTaW RHEA with high hardness (Vickersvalue = 565.7 HV). These suggest that femtosecond laser is influential in governing the mutual solubility of multiple elements and introduction of strengthening factors.

Here, we systematically explore the radiation tolerance of Mo–Nb–Ta–V–W alloys using molecular dynamics simulations and a machine-learned interatomic potential. Going from pure W to W-based equiatomic binaries, ternaries, quaternary, and the quinary high-entropy alloy, we simulate the radiation damage accumulation up to 0.4–0.8 dpa through cumulative collision cascades. We find that the radiation damage and evolution are controlled by a combination of cascade-induced clustering, the balance in migration of vacancies and interstitials, and defect cluster binding energies. These mechanisms are strongly influenced by atom size, among which vanadium as the smallest atom is decisive. In pure W and alloys without V, the microstructure is characterised by large and growing interstitial dislocation loops. In stark contrast, in alloys containing V, vacancy dislocation loops are formed directly in collision cascades and the balanced migration rate of vacancies and interstitials promotes recombination and prevents growth of interstitial loops. The atom size differences also lead to clear segregation, with small atoms (V) in interstitial clusters and larger atoms (Ta, Nb) segregating around vacancy clusters. Furthermore, the small cluster sizes, formation of vacancy loops, segregation, and balanced migration in V-containing alloys lead to low swelling and an exceptionally efficient defect annealing compared to pure W and V-free alloys.

A significant increase in the yield and ultimate compressive strengths with rising strain rates up to 3.0 × 103 s−1 was observed and attributed to enhanced dislocation activities and stress-induced microstructural transformations. The formation of the B2 phase and Zr5Al3 precipitates was found to be crucial in bolstering the alloy strength at high strain rates. Beyond strain rates of 3.0 × 103 s−1, a decrease in strength occurred due to thermal softening and strain localization. Microstructural analyses at 3.5 × 103 s−1 revealed grain refinement, the development of micro shear bands, and dislocation tangles, which were indicative of dynamic recrystallization.

CALPHAD calculations and experimental measurements revealed that RHEA alloys consist of two BCC phases (BCC1 and BCC2). Substitution of Ti atoms with Ta atoms was found to stabilize the BCC1 and increases its volume fraction. Ta enrichment also resulted in a coarser microstructure with increased Ta segregation in BCC1, and Zr segregation in BCC2 phases which resulted in an increase in the lattice parameters for both phases. DFT calculations predicted an improvement in the magnitudes of the elastic properties, bulk hardness and strength of the RHEAs by increasing Ta concentration, which is also supported by experimental results. Crystal orbital Hamiltonian population (COHP) and density of states (DOS) calculations indicated that the improvement in properties with increasing Ta content was due to the formation of strong directional metallic bonds and a higher percentage of occupied bonding states.

Very negative values for mixing enthalpy of atom pairs (ΔHmix) and remarkable differences between atomic sizes of the constitutive elements (δ) are key factors in the Laves phase formation in multicomponent alloys. The parameters including ΔHmix and δ must be in the defined range of −20 ≤ ΔHmix ≤ −3 kJ.mol−1 and 4 <δ < 10 to appear Laves phase in the microstructures of HEAs. TCP-Laves phase formation led to increase and decrease in hardness and fracture toughness, respectively. The understanding of key factors in RHEAs design can lead to phase engineering and the fabrication alloys with a desirable amount of TCP-Laves phase, which are suited for hydrogen storage applications or for applications in harsh operating environments exposed to high temperatures, irradiations, wear and erosion. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.jallcom.2024.174148

However, these typical lightweight alloys often suffer from poor room temperature plasticity. In this study, we prepared TiZrNbTa0.1Alx LWRHEAs by using a high-vacuum arc-melting technique and investigated the influence of Al content on the phase structures and mechanical properties. It was found that the TiZrNbTa0.1Al1 alloy showed a BCC solid solution matrix with some micrometer-sized Al3Zr5 precipitates and exhibited a density of 6.110 ± 0.003 g/cm3. The TiZrNbTa0.1Al1 alloy had a low mixed enthalpy of −20.831 kJ/mol, a compressive yield strength of 1037 ± 178 MPa, and a fracture plasticity of ∼6%. As a result of reducing the Al content, the TiZrNbTa0.1Al0.2 alloy showed a simple BCC phase structure without any precipitates and maintained a low density of 6.743 ± 0.008 g/cm3. The TiZrNbTa0.1Al0.2 alloy had a relatively high mixed enthalpy of −4.5577 kJ/mol, a high yield strength of 1022 ± 51 MPa, and a plasticity of >70%. The TEM analysis results demonstrated that the excellent mechanical properties of this LWRHEA were mainly attributed to the reducing Al content, which could elevate the mixed enthalpy of the alloy to eliminate the brittle Al3Zr5 phase and induce the formation of dense network dislocations at the grain boundaries. © 2024 Author(s).",10.1063/5.0205714

Our results can support the evidence that the observable minimum nanoparticle sizes of the NbMoTaWV and NbMoTaWVC RHEAs considerably decrease to approximately ∼100 nm. Furthermore, the average grain sizes are gradually refined and thus notably drop to around of 30–50 nm, and five elemental powders can be found to be homogeneously alloyed. The evidence can be confirmed that the order of solid solution may be proposed as follows: Nb → Mo → V → Ta → W. The chemical short-range order occurred at the local nanoscale of NbMoTaWV and NbMoTaWVC RHEAs. Meanwhile, further microstrutural analysis can demonstrate that NbMoTaWV and NbMoTaWVC RHEAs powders with ultrafined grain have a bcc phase structure and bcc + bct matrix phases combined with high-entropy tungsten carbides (NbMoTaWV)C and (NbMoTaWV)2C of nano-precipitated phases, respectively, suggesting that the martensitic transformation probably occurred.

In this study, the oxidation behavior of AlxHfNbTiVY0.05 (x = 0.75; 1; 1.25) high-entropy alloys was investigated at 700–900 °C. The isothermal oxidation tests showed that the oxidation resistance of AlxHfNbTiVY0.05 RHEA is strongly influenced by temperature and time. In addition, accelerated oxidation, known as pesting, was observed to occur at 700 °C for all alloys; while, partial spallation was observed at 800 °C for the Al1 and Al1.25 alloys. Detailed analyses of oxidation kinetics have been carried out for the oxidation test series at 900 °C.

In this work, we have prepared a series of (TiZr)65-XNb15Mo20CrX (x = 5,10,15,20) multi-principal elements alloys, by the addition of Cr to introduce the Laves phase for excellent high-temperature performance. The microstructure, phase constituents, and mechanical properties of the refractory high-entropy alloy were studied in the present work. Most of these alloys exhibited typical dendrite morphology, except for the alloy Cr5. Excessive Cr results in the formation of TiZr-enriched zones. In addition, twins can appear in as-cast alloys as a result of a significant lattice mismatch between the matrix and the Laves phase, which is caused by the rapid cooling process during melting. All alloys demonstrate remarkable strength when exposed to high temperatures, with compressive yields surpassing 552 MPa, peaking at 712 MPa at 800 °C, and compressive strains exceeding 30%. Benefiting from the Laves phase, the alloys do not show significant softening, making it possible for this alloy to work stably at 800 °C. Analyses of high-temperature specimens under different degrees of deformation reveal that small-sized Laves phases containing nano-twins precipitate in the matrix. The small-sized Laves phases and nano-twins restrict the movement of dislocations, leading to a large amount of dislocation accumulation, which improves the strength and plasticity of the alloy.

However, the mechanical properties of the oxygen-doped complex concentrated refractory alloy over a wide temperature range remain unclear. In this work, the effect of interstitial oxygen on the mechanical behavior of TiZrNb medium-entropy alloys (MEAs) has been investigated. At room temperature (RT), the interstitial oxygen improves the yield strength and tensile ductility owing to interstitial solid-solution strengthening and strain-hardening enhancement. However, simultaneous improvement of the RT strength-ductility by adding interstitial oxygen comes at the expense of increasing the ductile-brittle transition temperature (DBTT). Furthermore, the high-temperature yield strength of TiZrNb alloy can be improved up to 800 °C with the addition of 2 at% oxygen.

It poses a huge threat to environmental safety if not properly disposed, ascribed to its high contents of heavy metals. An innovative metallurgical approach was proposed a to recycle Cu, Cr, and Ni from it. Ammonia leaching was firstly performed to selectively leach Cu from Cr, in which the Cu oxide and sulfide were leached into the leachate while the Cr oxide and Ni carbide (NiCx) retained in the residue. (NH4)2SO4 increased the Cu leaching rate via increasing the dissolved oxygen amount in the ammonia leachate and converting CuS to Cu2+. Under the optimal conditions, the leaching efficiency of Cu achieved 96.5 % while that of Cr was only 0.1 %. In the followed aluminothermic reduction, C in the leaching residue could be effectively removed via a thermal oxidation, which in turn decreased the formation of a C-containing compound of high melting point and benefited the Cr and Ni recovery. Cr and Ni from the residue were reduced and recovered in a Cr-Ni alloy, and the reductant of Al first changed to a refractory Al2O3 and then transformed to a low melting point 12CaO·7Al2O3 with the additive of CaO. This transformation increased the molten slag fluidity and promoted the separation of Cr-Ni alloy from slag. Moreover, the excessive Al increased the Cr and Ni yields and concentrated all of them to be together. Partial Al was used as reductant, and the other Al transferred into Cr-Ni alloy to decrease its melting point. Cr and Ni contents in the smelting slag could be decreased to 0.11 wt% and 0.12 wt% respectively, showing an efficient recovery.

In this paper, Ni8Cr4Co4Fe6W2 was designed by means of composition control. Its spherical powders with uniform composition were successfully prepared by high temperature remelting spheroidization (PHTR) method, compared with gas atomization (GA) method. The strain rate sensitivity m values of GA-Selective Laser Melting and PHTR-Selective Laser Melting samples were 0.030 and 0.027, respectively. The hardness of Ni8Cr4Co4Fe6W2 high-entropy alloy showed a trend of continuous increase with the decrease of grain size, while the elastic modulus didn't change much (PHTR-SLM is 193 Gpa and GA-SLM is 189 Gpa).

Here the temperature-dependent IF spectra of NbTiV0.5Zr refractory MPEAs with varying O contents were presented, and the analysis of these data indicates that for O-doped NbTiV0.5Zr MPEAs, the O addition triggers two anelastic IF peaks (the PO1 and PO2), corresponding to the O-Snoek-type relaxation in random solid solution (RSS) and local chemical ordering (LCO) structures, respectively. The half-peak width of the PO1 is 2–3 times broader than that for SPEAs, associated with the wide O migration energy barrier distribution in MPEAs. These phenomena show a striking contrast to the single and narrow Snoek-type peak observed for SPEAs. Our analysis further reveals an approximate linear correlation between the half-peak width of the Snoek-type peak and the mixing entropy. The introduction of O also shifts grain boundary relaxation peaks (PG) towards higher temperatures. Interestingly, high-temperature anomalous modulus changes were observed for the first time in TiV-based lightweight refractory MPEAs, which is suggested to be originated from the order reduction of the body-centered cubic (bcc) structure at elevated temperatures. Moreover, the 1 at.%O doped NbTiV0.5Zr MPEA with a favorable balance between the peak heights of the PO2 and PG, exhibits outstanding specific yield stress (SYS) among refractory MPEAs while maintaining an elongation as high as 20 %.

Nonetheless, similar to conventional V-Ti-based alloys such as V-4Ti-4Cr, these alloys are sensitive to C/N/O interstitial impurities. Under irradiation, such impurities may promote the formation of precipitates which may affect the defect evolution, especially at the appearance of helium. Previous studies have observed different helium behavior in the above alloys, including the heterogeneous distribution of helium bubbles in VTiTa, but the origin was not clear. In this work, detailed microstructural characterization is performed to analyze the irradiation induced precipitates and their impact on helium bubble formation in these alloys. Under helium ion irradiation at 700°C, the TiN precipitates with the NaCl-type structure are formed in all the three alloys. Nonetheless, the interfaces between precipitates and matrix in VTiTa and VTiTaNb are semi-coherent while those in V-4Ti-4Cr are coherent, due to the various lattice parameters of the alloys. Moreover, severe lattice distortion is also found inside the precipitates in the two RHEAs. Consequently, significant heterogeneous nucleation of He bubbles is observed in these two RHEAs but not in V-4Ti-4Cr. Among the three alloys, the growth of precipitates is the fastest in VTiTa, causing the formation of bubble clusters. Furthermore, the growth direction as well as the shape of precipitates affects the shape of bubbles, leading to the {001} cuboids shape in V-4Ti-4Cr and the truncated {110} dodecahedra shape in V-Ti-Ta and V-Ti-Ta-Nb. © 2024",10.1016/j.jnucmat.2024.155078

The development of high entropy alloys provides a feasible way to overcome such vulnerabilities. Herein, we explore the response of refractory multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs), WTaTi, WTaCrV, and WTaCrVTi under He implantation and compare the results with pure W. To this end, we have parameterized the interatomic interactions between the constitutive metals and He. With the developed empirical potential, we show that the formation and binding energies of He bubbles in MPEAs are lower than those in W, suggesting a reduced thermodynamical driving force to form large He bubbles in MPEAs. Simulations of He implantation further reveal that the distribution of injected He only weakly depends on the surface orientations in MPEAs. In addition, He bubbles in MPEAs are much smaller and discretely positioned.

The fracture pattern of HT9 and TaWVCr/HT9 both show the ductile fracture. Comprehensive microstructural characterizations from atomic-scale examinations to micro-scale fracture analyses were performed to illustrate the underlying mechanisms of the liquid LBE corrosion. It was revealed that the corrosion of HT9 is related to the surface oxide scale cracking, which propagates into the matrix but terminated in the Cr2O3 enriched zone at the crack tip. On the contrary, the stress concentration caused by local degradation of the TaWVCr coating accelerates the oxidation and dissolution of the coating in LBE, leading to the formation of a duplex oxide layer underneath the coating, which allows cracks initiate in the magnetite layer and annihilate in the chromite layer.

The samples were processed by cold-rolling and subsequent annealing to produce fully recrystallized microstructures consisting of a single-phase body-centered cubic (BCC) structure with different mean grain sizes ranging from ∼25 μm to ∼244 μm. The mechanical tests on these samples revealed that grain size refinement had minimal impact on yield strength but effectively improved ductility. Specifically, a low Hall-Petch coefficient of 45 MPa μm1/2, denoting weak grain boundary strengthening, and a high lattice friction stress of 751 MPa, indicating strong solid solution strengthening, were acquired. These findings underscore the significant role played by lattice distortion in contributing to the strength of this LRHEA. Additionally, in the present LRHEA, dislocation structures demonstrated a planar slip dislocation glide mode. No deformation-induced twinning and phase transformation were observed. As the strain increases, the dynamic slip band spacing refinement serves as the primary mechanism for strain hardening, leading to excellent tensile ductility. © 2024",10.1016/j.msea.2024.146513

The effect of Ti content on the microstructure and mechanical properties of TaMoNbCrTix RHEAs was investigated. The results revealed that the alloys consisted of a body-centred cubic (BCC) matrix and Laves phase, with the addition of Ti promoting the formation of the Ti(O, N) phase. By employing severe deformation of the ball-milled powder, short sintering time, and the inhibition of precipitated phases on grain growth, the resulting RHEAs exhibited ultrafine grains measuring less than 1 μm. As the Ti content increased, the volume fraction of the Laves phase decreased, transitioning from a reticulated to a dispersed distribution. This shift had a positive influence on the ductility of the alloys.

The RHEA annealed at 970 ℃ was composed of fully-recrystallized grains of size 25 μm surrounded by nanosized grains.

Introducing topologically close-packed (TCP) phases offers a promising avenue to significantly enhance their strength. However, precipitation of these crystallographically ordered phases is usually limited to their strict composition, giving rise to a high energy barrier for nucleation. Essentially, the challenge lies in stimulating the nucleation of these strengthening media and optimizing the microstructure and mechanical properties of the alloy. In this work, we chose the CrCoNi MEA as the prototype and substituted Cr with refractory elements like W and Mo to adjust the compositions and atomic configurations of the TCP phase (i.e., the μ phase). Our investigation reveals that the addition of W leads to the formation of μ phase particles with a non-stoichiometric composition, inducing imperfect crystallographic packing (i.e., planar defects) within the particles. This trend lowers the nucleation energy barrier, resulting in an increased volume fraction of the μ phase and then effectively restraining the growth of FCC matrix grains. Consequently, both precipitation strengthening and grain boundary strengthening effects are enhanced, leading to a dramatic increase in yield strength from 427 MPa in CrCoNi to 1356 MPa in W0.3Cr0.7CoNi. Conversely, the addition of Mo fails to alter the composition and atomic configuration of the μ phase particles, resulting in a weaker strengthening effect.

As more W diffused into inter-dendrites, the variation of Cr and V in inter-dendrites reduced from approximately 20.0% to less than 2.0%. Similar melting removal mechanisms led to an analogous relationship between the machining performance and processing conditions of the two RHEAs. Compared to the relatively high surface roughness achieved by wire-EDM, the optimized Ra values of 0.329 and 0.728 μm for (TiVCr)95W5 and (FeVCr)95W5, respectively, demonstrated the superiority of sinking EDM for RHEAs. The present findings have confirmed the superior controllable sinking EDM performance for W-containing RHEAs, providing useful guidance for the processing of W-containing RHEAs in practical applications. © Youke Publishing Co., Ltd 2024.",10.1007/s42864-024-00300-1

This study deals with the development of a novel HEA through a microwave-assisted powder metallurgy, which is an economical approach and overcome the limitations of conventional fabrication techniques. A series of multi-principal alloys are developed, and noted that the HEA is developed through 15 h of ball milling of metallic powders followed by compaction and microwave sintering at 1400 °C at controlled heating and cooling rates. Thus, developed alloys were further examined to record their mechanical properties, tribological, and corrosion responses. The microstructural and metallurgical changes were recorded using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), and X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). Finally, the tribological and corrosive responses were recorded using a multifunctional tribometer and a potentiostat (potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)). It is observed that the 1400 °C sintered HEA exhibited superior mechanical, tribological, and corrosive properties. It is worth hypothesizing that the transformation of dual phases (BCC and FCC) to the single BCC phase was responsible for the exceptional properties.

Here we present a HfNbTiVAl10 alloy that shows remarkable tensile ductility (roughly 20%) and ultrahigh yield strength (roughly 1,390 megapascals). Notably, these are among the best synergies compared with other related alloys. Such superb synergies derive from the addition of aluminium to the HfNbTiV alloy, resulting in a negative mixing enthalpy solid solution, which promotes strength and favours the formation of hierarchical chemical fluctuations (HCFs). The HCFs span many length scales, ranging from submicrometre to atomic scale, and create a high density of diffusive boundaries that act as effective barriers for dislocation motion. Consequently, versatile dislocation configurations are sequentially stimulated, enabling the alloy to accommodate plastic deformation while fostering substantial interactions that give rise to two unusual strain-hardening rate upturns. Thus, plastic instability is significantly delayed, which expands the plastic regime as ultralarge tensile ductility.

Here, the influences of chemistry and temperature on the deformation mechanisms of the equiatomic MoNbTaW RHEAs are investigated, using the large-scale atomic simulations. According to the microstructure evolution, a microstructure-based constitutive model is established to study the effects of the multiple strengthening mechanisms. The results show the jagged sharp fluctuations of the flow stress with the strain after the strain hardening. The increasing temperature reduces the strain-hardening rate and the amplitude of fluctuations in the flow stress, due to the reduction of the solute concentration for the annealed structure. The deformation twinning plays a certain role in the deformation mechanism in comparison with dislocation, and the local deformation is further accommodated via the dislocation-based plasticity, and amorphous nucleation in the grains. The existence of the ordered structure affects the stress and strain partition dependent upon the mechanical properties. The solid solution strengthening and grain boundary strengthening contribute considerably to the flow stress, and twinning strengthening contributes relatively little to the flow stress.

The significant tendency of Zr in respect of separation from the matrix was found as the main reason for the causing thermal instability.

This effect was correlated to the strength of specific solid-state pair interactions using the projected crystal orbital Hamilton population analysis, and they were found to be weak except for W-Mo and W-Ta. Since the interactions involving Tungsten are stronger than the other interactions, stacking fault and twin formation are less likely to happen near tungsten-rich portions of the alloy. This suggests the formation of tungsten-deficient twin boundaries in NbMoTaW which will further improve the ductility of the system. Stable twin fault energy as low as 522 mJ/m2 is reported for the equimolar random atomic configurations of the HEA system. The ratio between twin boundary migration energy and the difference in unstable stacking fault energies ([Formula presented]) was found to be as low as 0.13 suggesting deformation twinning can happen in the HEA system.

In order to determine the stability of these alloys, ex-situ heat treatments coupled with XRD studies were conducted. As opposed to CALPHAD calculations it was not observed any HCP phase formation. Compression test results showed that Hf5Mo15Nb35Ta25Ti20 alloys have high strength (σy = ∼1300 MPa) and high compressive ductility with good strain-hardening ability.

In pure metals, SIA generally adopt split configurations and display fast mobilities along one-dimensional trajectories. This differentiates them from vacancies, which move in confined three-dimensional paths. This asymmetry is one of the pillars of irradiation damage theories that have been successful in explaining a number features of the irradiation response of pure metals and dilute alloys. However, in complex concentrated alloys consisting of several metallic elements in equal or near equal proportions, lattice distortions associated with compositional fluctuations change the potential energy landscape on atomic scales, leading to SIA structures not seen in their pure metal counterparts. In this paper, we use atomistic simulations to study the properties of self-interstitial atoms in the quaternary equiatomic Nb–Mo–Ta–W refractory alloy. Chemically, these SIA defects adopt a variety of structures involving all pairs of atoms. We find the 〈111〉 orientation to be the most common among all split configurations, but we also observe – surprisingly – a relatively high occurrence of octahedral SIA. In terms of their diffusivities, we find two clearly distinguished regimes below and above 600 K, where the SIA diffusion changes dimensionality from 1D to 3D. We calculate the migration energies and diffusion pre-factors in both regions, from which we extract the translational and rotational components of the defect migration. We find values of 0.25 eV and pre-factors of ∼10−11 m2 s−1 in the low temperature regime, and 0.57 eV and ∼10−8 m2 s−1 in the high temperature one. From this, we estimate a rotational energy barrier of 0.37 eV. © 2024 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.commatsci.2023.112765

In this study, the designed body-centered cubic NbZrTiAl4 (atomic percent, at%) MEA by Al addition, having a superplastic extensibility of ~ 5000% under cold rolling, enables directly fabricated ultrathin foils with a thickness down to ~ 0.2 mm without any treatments. Particularly, the annealed NbZrTiAl4 MEA foils, containing a coherent nanoscale B2, exhibit an ultrahigh yield strength of up to ~ 1130 MPa, which even surpasses the bulk counterpart, while maintaining a good fracture elongation of up to ~ 14%. The Al addition induced a stronger solid solution strengthening and fine-grain strengthening in the foils. Complex dislocation interactions and dislocation–B2 interactions promoted a dynamical formation of dislocation bands, which yielded work-hardening ability and tensile ductility.

However, the introduction of high-strength brittle phase in RHEA coatings commonly increases the cracking tendency and affects their service life. In this work, we propose a design strategy to enhance the mechanical properties of RHEA coatings by introducing an extremely stable high strength boride combined with a ductile phase. Experimentally, LaB6/NbNiTaTi RHEA coatings mainly consist of BCC phase, in-situ TaB phase and NiTi/IM eutectic phase. TaB phase with high-density (110) nanotwins inside presents needle-like morphology with the long side axis parallel to the [001] direction. Excessive needle-like TaB phase is fully fused and fractured due to its preferential growth along a specific direction. The fracture surface analysis shows that BCC phase bears the main deformation, NiTi phase can relieve stress concentration at the boundary while bearing a small amount of deformation. By contrast, the low-density dislocation distribution and the low energy extended dislocation structure in TaB phase exhibit the phase stability.

Here, we investigate the effect of SRO on the dislocation nucleation, propagation, and reaction at a crack tip in a body-centered-cubic (BCC) MoTaTiWZr RHEA, using a combination of molecular dynamic simulations and Monte Carlo methods. Our results indicate that this RHEA is energetically favorable to form SRO, developing a pseudo-composite microstructure with low-energy clusters (LECs), medium-energy clusters (MECs), and high-energy clusters (HECs). The HECs at the crack tip are favorable sites for dislocation nucleation whereas the MECs surrounding the HECs function as a strong matrix to stabilize the weak HECs. At elevated temperatures, the HECs near the crack tip transform to severely distorted BCC and disordered structures, which can cause the breakup, absorption, and annihilation of emitted dislocations and nucleation of new dislocations.

This study aims to evaluate the effect of aging treatment at distinct temperatures on the phase composition, microstructure, and selected mechanical properties of non-equiatomic TiZrNbTaMo and TiZrMoNbTaMn HEAs for potential use as biomedical implants. The TiZrNbTaMn sample exhibited a single BCC phase, while the TiZrNbTaMo a major BCC and minor HCP phases. The microstructure of the TiZrNbTaMo sample was composed of BCC grains with some acicular precipitations of the HCP phase in the grain boundaries, having the aging temperature acted in the grain growth and secondary phase precipitation. Contrarily, the TiZrNbTaMn sample exhibited larger BCC grains permeated with a minor amount of acicular structures, which were entirely decomposed with the aging treatments. The semi-quantitative chemical analysis indicated that the phase composition was a result of elemental chemical segregation, having the refractory metals (Mo, Ta, and Nb) preferentially located in the inner region of the grains, while the other ones (Ti, Zr, and Mn) in the grain boundary. The aging treatment acted in the phase precipitation/dissolution oppositely on the samples through the atomic diffusion mechanism induced by the temperature.

The typical interfacial microstructure and the effect of brazing temperature on the microstructure and mechanical properties were thoroughly discussed. The results indicated the formation of complex oxides on the ZrO2 ceramic side, including Ti2O, Ni2Ti4O and (Hf, Ta, Zr)O2. Additionally, the RHEA substrate near the brazing seam underwent a transformation from a single BCC phase to double BCC phases, which included a TaNb-rich BCC-1 phase and a Zr-rich BCC-2 phase. The formation of the double BCC phases was caused by the spinodal decomposition. As the brazing temperature rose, the thickness of the oxides layer slightly increased and the double BCC phases formed from the beginning and progressively coarsened. The maximum room shear strength was 124.1 MPa when the joint was obtained at 1040 °C for 10 min.

In this paper, the enthalpy-difference-guided strategy, incorporating Pt, was employed to induce spinodal decomposition for the barrier-free nanomultilayer structure in refractory HEA systems. Aiming at exploring the elastic and chemical interactions, three HEA films with different degrees of size mismatch δ (Zr-Nb-Ta-Mo-W, Zr-Hf-Nb-Ta-Mo, Zr-Hf-Nb-Cr-Mo systems) were fabricated as model systems. Contributed by differences in ΔHmix and δ, in each HEA film, certain-content Pt can trigger both spinodal decomposition and amorphization behavior, which lead to the barrier-free Pt-rich/Pt-lean nanomultilayers with different topological combinations: crystalline/crystalline and amorphous/amorphous. Compared to model HEAs, such barrier-free nanomultilayers can significantly improve the nanoindentation hardness.

The current MEAM potential aligns closely with recent experimental work, validating its effectiveness. Adding Zr to the VNbTaTi alloy induces more lattice distortion, matching recent experimental observations.

A comprehensive study was conducted to elucidate the effect of Nb content on the microstructure, microhardness and wear resistance of NbxMo0.5Ti1.5Ta0.2Cr RHEAcs before and after annealing at 900 °C for 10 h. The results show that the grains are gradually refined with the increase of Nb content. The coating consists mainly of a body-centered cubic (BCC) solid solution, C15-Laves phase, and a small amount of hexagonal close-packed (HCP) solid solution containing Ti. The microhardness of RHEAcs is significantly higher compared to the base material. Notably, at Nb1.3, due to the possibility of dislocation, the microhardness reaches a peak of 1066.5 HV, which is about 7.11 times higher than that of the base material. On the contrary, at Nb2, the microhardness is at its lowest point, averaging 709.31 HV, but 4.72 times that of the base material. After annealing, an increase in microhardness is observed at all Nb concentrations, up to 31.2% at Nb2. Before annealing, the wear resistance of RHEAcs was slightly better than that of 316L stainless steel at different Nb contents. However, after annealing, the coefficient of friction (COF) and wear rate of the coatings are lower than those of annealed 316L stainless steel, highlighting their excellent wear resistance. It is noteworthy that the loss of wear properties after annealing at Nb1 is at a minimum, obtaining the most balanced wear resistance before and after annealing. The enhanced wear resistance after annealing can be attributed to the presence of ultra-fine grain oxide friction layers, mainly composed of TiO2 and Ta2O5. The main mode of wear is oxidative wear, with a small amount of wear from abrasive wear. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.intermet.2024.108229

Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is a prominent additive manufacturing process. It uses thermal energy to bind powder materials together to build plastic or metal parts. The technology has a remarkable effect on improving the corrosion resistance and wear resistance of the agitating blade coatings. However, the traditional gas atomization method (GA) often produce alloy powder (containing refractory element, such as Nb, W) with uneven composition, affecting the quality and performance of specimens. That is why innovative or opposite classical production powder methods are in demand for LPBF. It is worth noting the mechanical alloying - high temperature remelting spheroidization dual process (DP) method could overcome the limitation of high temperature alloying of HEA containing refractory elements and realizes solid alloying of insoluble elements. In this paper, high entropy alloy Al2FeCrMnTix (x=0.25,0.5,0.75,1) is designed by means of composition control. The experimental results show that Al2FeCrMnTix is a single phase solid solution BCC structure. With the increase of Ti content, the corrosion resistance of Al2FeCrMnTix HEA coatings were enhanced at a certain range in simulated saturated brine solution. When Ti=0.75, the self-corrosion voltage is -0.179V and the self-corrosion current is 5.764×10-6 mA·cm-2. All coatings offer better corrosion resistance than 316L stainless steel substrates. Particularly, the Al2FeCrMnTix HEA coating can greatly improve the microhardness and wear resistance of the material surface. The average microhardness value of HEA coating reaches up to the maximum (726 HV0.2) when Ti=1, which is about 3.6 times that of the base matrix (316L). These findings have clear implications for coatings used to protect surfaces. Overall, It is clear that Ti0.75 represents lower volume wear rates and smoother wear surfaces, demonstrating better corrosion and wear resistance compared to other coatings. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",10.1088/1742-6596/2821/1/012010

The samples present a large proportion of non-melted Ta particles, due to the low max power of the used laser (500W) and of the high melting-point of Ta. It was found that using a two-step deposition process (deposition, followed by a powder-less re-melting pass) could allow to homogenize the samples and melt said Ta particles.

The objective of this work is to further our comprehension of the unique behavioral, physical, structural, and nuclear radiation attenuation characteristics shown by High-Entropy Alloys (HEA) and Refractory-High entropy alloy (RHEA) materials. Accordingly, two high entropy alloy (HEA) samples through two different compositions were produced. The first composition under consideration is the typical high-entropy alloy (HEA) defined as MnCrFeNiCoMo0.5. The second composition under consideration is a refractory high entropy alloy (RHEA) characterized by the following elemental composition: TiZrNbHfVTa0.1. SEM and EDX analyses were conducted in terms of determining their physical and structural attributes. Next, a133Ba radioisotope together with a HPGe detector were utilized for gamma-ray transmission experiments. Finally, a241Am/Be source and a gas proportional detector were used for neutron absorption experiments for HEA and RHEA samples. The alloy structures displayed a unique degree of uniformity. Throughout the RHEA phase, the incorporation of refractory elements did not provide any discernible adverse impacts on the physical stability. The counting spectrum provided a clear explanation of the gamma ray absorption features shown by the RHEA (R) sample, highlighting its exceptional absorption properties. Regarding the absorption properties of neutrons, it was observed that RHEA had a comparatively reduced amount of absorption. Therefore, it can be concluded that the basic structure of RHEA grants it superior gamma-ray attenuation qualities compared to HEA.

This rarely encountered complex oxide can effectively prevent the outward diffusion of metal cations from the RHEAs. Moreover, the oxidation kinetics of CrTaO4forming RHEAs is comparable to that of the well-known oxidation resistant Cr2O3- and Al2O3-forming Ni-based superalloys. However, CrTaO4 has been ignored and its mechanical and thermal properties have yet to be studied. To fill this research gap and explore the untapped potential for its applications, here we report for the first time the microstructure, mechanical and thermal properties of CrTaO4 prepared by hot-press sintering of solid-state reaction synthesized powders.

By incorporating two crucial inputs, the local atomic type and displacement, our model enables accurate and efficient prediction of the Peierls barriers in multi-component space.

Subsequently, three screened compositions with different barriers are selected for studying their effects on dislocation motion. Atomistic simulations reveal that a higher mean barrier slows down dislocation mobility, while a broader distribution of barriers facilitates kink pair nucleation, altering the rate-limiting process from kink pair nucleation to kink glide and cross kinking.

This phenomenon has been extensively documented by researchers, and it is primarily attributed to a range of competing factors, including the mixing enthalpy, mixing entropy, and disparities in atomic sizes among the constituent elements present in these HEAs. HEAs have significantly expanded the available composition space for the design and fabrication of alloys. Consequently, it is of great importance to rigorously classify HEAs according to their component constituents. The principal categories encompass transition metal (TM) HEAs, refractory HEAs (RHEAs), lightweight HEAs, and HE-bulk metallic glasses. Among these, the most extensive class of HEAs consists of TMs, and these HEAs display an extensive array of chemical components, microstructures, and properties, allowing for additional subclassification. In contrast, RHEAs are composed of refractory elements with high melting points, primarily designed for use in high-temperature applications. The development of HEAs, such as lightweight HEAs, introduces new challenges, and prospects in the realm of advancing materials for critical applications. As a result, this chapter aims to offer a comprehensive overview of subgroups, intermetallic, and amorphous phases, and the impact of interstitial elements that have been investigated in various types of HEAs. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

Recent works indicate that forming a CrTaO4 protection layer gives HEAs excellent long-term oxidation resistance. In this study, the high-temperature oxidation resistance properties of CrTaTiMo Refractory Medium-Entropy Alloys (RMEAs) were assessed by Density Functional Theory (DFT) and ab initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD). Through the oxygen adsorption and diffusion calculations, we demonstrated the preferential oxygen adsorption sequence on the surface of the RMEA as Ti, Ta, Cr, and Mo. Furthermore, our analysis identified the sites featuring Ta as subsurface atoms were the weakest locations for oxygen atom diffusion. The dynamic oxidation mechanism of oxygen molecules on CrTaTiMo RMEA was investigated by AIMD simulations. The results confirmed that the adsorption and dissociation of O2 molecules on the alloy surface. Additionally, the diffusion of the O atom took place at temperatures greater than 873 K and confirmed the O-attracting feature of Ta atoms. Moreover, electronic structure calculations confirmed the bonding of oxygen atoms with those four metal elements.

Within the given range of O content, the single body-centered cubic (BCC) solid solution structure of the base alloy remained unchanged. However, the morphology of the dendrites displayed noticeable alterations with increase in oxygen content. The study revealed a positive correlation between the oxygen content and the hardness and yield strength of the alloys. This trend was attributed to the presence of oxygen atoms in the solid solution of the BCC matrix, which contributed to the alloy’s enhanced strength. The alloy containing 0.5 at.% oxygen exhibited the highest ductility among all the studied compositions. The improved ductility could be attributed to the relatively large fraction of the dendrites with smoother and blunt boundaries. These features effectively reduced stress concentration and increased the complexity of the facture surface, thereby enhancing the ductility of the alloy.

Phase constitution and microstructural characteristics of the coatings were characterized, and their tribological properties at high temperature were studied. The results show that the RHEA coating is composed of columnar grains with FCC structure. As the laser power increases from 25 W to 75 W, the grain size of the coating becomes smaller, the thickness increases, and the microhardness increases. The increase in hardness can be attributed to the inherent solid solution hardening of high-entropy alloys, and the combined effects of boundary strengthening and stress strengthening caused by high laser power-induced grain refinement and residual stress enhancement. At 600 °C, the average friction coefficients of the RHEA-coated and uncoated samples are 0.45 and 0.60, respectively. The RHEA-coated samples have narrower and shallower wear marks and lower wear rates, and this phenomenon becomes more and more obvious as the laser power increases.

In this study, the low-density, strong and ductile BCC Mo0.3Nb1.3TiZr RHEA was designed and prepared, and the isothermal oxidation mechanism was studied at mainly 800 °C. To effectively improve the oxidation resistance of the alloy, dual coating layers with inner-layer aluminide and outer-layer silica protection were designed and investigated. Firstly, pack cementation was used to prepare aluminide coating on RHEA. Secondly, the sol-gel method was used to deposit silica films over the aluminide coating. With single aluminide coating deposited on the base metal, the weight gain was reduced from 92.2 mg/cm2 of uncoated specimen to 4.5 mg/cm2 at 800 °C for 24 h. With the dual coating layers, no pest phenomenon was observed between 700 °C and 900 °C and the weight gain dropped sharply from 88.4 mg/cm2 of aluminized specimen to 2.8 mg/cm2 at 800 °C for 48 h. The aluminide coating and SiO2 film successfully adhered to the surface of the RHEA. In addition, the SiO2 film reduced the consumption of aluminide coating.

In this work, we successfully achieved RT plasticization in a brittle (TaMoTi)92Al8 RHEA via in situ forming heterogeneous structure (HS) with the doping of Zr. Different from the mainstream design concept of “soft solid solution matrices with hard intermetallic phases” proposed in the literature, the newly developed TaMoZrTiAl RHEA is featured by a hard disordered BCC phase embedded into a soft intermetallic B2 matrix. Such an HS leads to the remarkable strength–plasticity synergy in this alloy at RT, showing a large plasticity of > 20 %, associated with a high strength of > 2380 MPa. It was found that solid solution strengthening and heterodeformation-induced strengthening caused by dislocation pile-ups at phase boundaries are responsible for the enhancement in the yield strength, while deformation-induced strain partition and the frequent operation of dislocation cross-slip substantially improve the work hardening capacity of alloy, thus enabling the high strength and good RT plasticity. In short, the current work not only reveals the micromechanisms of the influence of heterogeneous dual-phase structure on the RT mechanical behaviour in RHEAs but also provides a useful strategy for plasticizing brittle RHEAs. © 2024",

This effect was correlated to the strength of specific solid-state pair interactions using the projected crystal orbital Hamilton population analysis, and they were found to be weak except for W-Mo and W-Ta. Since the interactions involving Tungsten are stronger than the other interactions, stacking fault and twin formation are less likely to happen near tungsten-rich portions of the alloy. This suggests the formation of tungsten-deficient twin boundaries in NbMoTaW which will further improve the ductility of the system. Stable twin fault energy as low as 522 mJ/m2 is reported for the equimolar random atomic configurations of the HEA system.

This differentiates them from vacancies, which move in confined three-dimensional paths. This asymmetry is one of the pillars of irradiation damage theories that have been successful in explaining a number features of the irradiation response of pure metals and dilute alloys. However, in complex concentrated alloys consisting of several metallic elements in equal or near equal proportions, lattice distortions associated with compositional fluctuations change the potential energy landscape on atomic scales, leading to SIA structures not seen in their pure metal counterparts. In this paper, we use atomistic simulations to study the properties of self-interstitial atoms in the quaternary equiatomic Nb–Mo–Ta–W refractory alloy. Chemically, these SIA defects adopt a variety of structures involving all pairs of atoms. We find the 〈111〉 orientation to be the most common among all split configurations, but we also observe – surprisingly – a relatively high occurrence of octahedral SIA. In terms of their diffusivities, we find two clearly distinguished regimes below and above 600 K, where the SIA diffusion changes dimensionality from 1D to 3D. We calculate the migration energies and diffusion pre-factors in both regions, from which we extract the translational and rotational components of the defect migration.

The addition of a small number of nanoparticles, process optimization and post-treatment can eliminate the crack defects. Pore defects can be divided into four types: unfused pore, metallurgical pore, micro pore and shrinkage pore. The main control method of pore defects is process optimization. By controlling the defects, the forming of RHEA and its properties are improved greatly. Additive manufacturing of RHEAs is an effective method to develop new alloys quickly. The process parameters of laser additive technology are numerous, strongly coupled and nonlinear. Single-factor experiment, numerical overlap optimization of molten pool and numerical simulation are the rapid optimization strategies for laser additive manufacturing of RHEA. Laser additive manufacturing enables rapid development iterations of RHEA. By mechanical mixing powder or preforming alloy powder, laser additive manufacturing technology can realize the formation of various metal powders by varying component ratios, and realize the rapid screening and performance evaluation of alloy composition. NbMoTaW alloys have very high strength but poor ductility, which can be strengthened and toughened by appropriately adding low melting point ductility elements and reducing brittle elements in the matrix. HfNbTaZr alloy has good plasticity, but the yield strength is generally low, which can be strengthened by adding strengthening elements. Due to the difficulty of controlling the forming crack defects, there are few studies on the tensile properties of RHEA formed by laser additive manufacturing. And more research work is needed, especially major breakthroughs in material mechanism and forming process. Finally, the complex structural parts formed by laser additive manufacturing for RHEA is still in the initial attempt stage. Conclusions and Prospects In this paper, the research on RHEAs formed by laser additive manufacturing is reviewed, and the development approaches, forming process and defect control, and the main research and challenges on mechanical properties of refractory high entropy alloys at multiple temperature stages are summarized. The research progress of complex parts of refractory high entropy alloy is introduced. Finally, the future application and development trend of RHEA formed by additive manufacturing are discussed. The integrated manufacturing of materials and shape is essential for RHEA, and laser additive manufacturing is the development direction of component manufacturing. The progress of materials and processes is the prerequisite for the integral forming of complex components in RHEA formed by laser additive manufacturing. At present, it has the ability to form simple samples, so more in-depth research is needed to accelerate the industrial application process of integrated manufacturing of shape and properties for RHEA in laser additive manufacturing. © 2024 Science Press.

The room-temperature brittleness and oxygen sensitivity greatly restrict their further processing and application. Here, utilizing the unique high strength of Vanadium (V) among alloy elements and cocktail effect of HEAs, we designed a MoTaVW RHEAs with equal atomic ratio, that exhibit multiphase phases (Ta-rich, Mo-rich and V-rich phase) with different composition at different sintering temperatures and the alloy elements in BCC solid solution tend to be uniformly distributed as the increased sintering temperature. Exploring the room-temperature compressive properties and underlying deformation mechanisms, the MoTaVW RHEAs exhibit the yield strength (σy) of 1420 MPa and the plastic strain (εp) of 18 %, that achieved good combination of strength and plasticity compared with other most known BCC RHEAs, which are attributed to high solid solution strengthening caused by lattice distortion and the cross slip of screw dislocations on the close-packed plane that can enhance the synergistic effect of strength and plasticity.

All the RHEAs consist of a single body-centered cubic (BCC) phase. As the Mo content increases from 0 at.% to 7 at.%, the yield strength of RHEAs increases from 670 MPa to 975 MPa at room temperature. The high strength of the BCC RHEAs mainly depends on solid-solution strengthening caused by the Mo addition. The RHEAs with low Mo content (0–5 at.%) can possess high tensile plasticity of ∼20 %, while it reflects brittle after the 7 at.% Mo addition. The high tensile plasticity of the RHEAs was attributed to the combined effects of lattice rotation to promote and refine crystalline strengthening. The RHEAs with 5 at.% Mo addition have high specific yield strength (∼32 MPa g−1cm3) and excellent fracture strains (＞60 %) at 1173 K. Moreover, the incipient plasticity of the RHEAs was analyzed by nanoindentation. It is shown that the maximum shear stress (τmax) of the RHEAs from 1.80–2.34 GPa to 2.67–4.83 GPa.

Nevertheless, the strength of TiZrHf-based RHEAs at medium temperatures has hindered the further application. This work proposed a novel approach to improve the mechanical properties of TiZrHf-based RHEAs. An innovative series of Ti40Zr20Hf40-xCrx (x = 19, 24 and 29, denoted by HfCr19, HfCr24 and HfCr29, respectively) eutectic refractory high entropy alloys (ERHEAs) were designed and prepared. The designed Ti40Zr20Hf40-xCrx alloys can form lamellar eutectic structure including BCC/HCP phase and Laves precipitating phase in solidification with the decrease of Hf/Cr ratio. The microstructure of HfCr19 and HfCr24 alloys was composed of BCC, HCP and Laves phase, while the HfCr29 alloy consisted of BCC and Laves phase. The formation of HCP phase in the Ti40Zr20Hf40-xCrx alloy were attributed to the lattice of Ti0.5Zr0.5 phase reconstruction during the rapid cooling, which promoted the formation of isomers in the alloy. Hence, the part of BCC phase was transformed into HCP phase in the HfCr19 and HfCr24 alloys, and the lamellar eutectic structure consisted of BCC/HCP phase and Laves phase. In addition, compared with the near-eutectic HfCr19 and HfCr29 alloys, the HfCr24 alloy with a complete lamellar eutectic structure has higher compressive strength at room temperature, which can reach 1648.7 MPa. In addition, the compressive strength (1261.7 MPa) can still be achieved at 600 °C.

The strength and ductility data of the Nb-based refractory systems in varying temperature ranges manufactured by various methods have been compiled and discussed to correlate the manufacturing, material characteristics, deformation, and strength behavior. The microstructure characteristics and the interstitial contaminations have been identified as the dominating factors in controlling strength behavior in the low-temperature range of the Nb alloys. In the intermediate temperature range, the dynamic strain recovery plays a significant role in dictating the strength behavior, while, in the high-temperature domain, the diffusion-assisted deformation process leads to significant strength reduction. Nb-based RHEAs have been found to have great potential for applications in extreme temperatures (> 1200°C). A wide range of strength and ductility is possible in Nb-based RHEAs.

RMPEAs can be designed to exhibit a wide range of properties by tailoring their composition. However, the vast chemical design space makes brute-force experimental screening inefficient and costly. In this work, we follow a closed-loop, iterative computational/experimental screening approach that combines computational alloy design methodologies with high-throughput synthesis and characterization tools to explore the vast RMPEAs space and design new RMPEAs that satisfy multiple objectives and constraints. In particular, we targeted compositions with yield strengths higher than 50 MPa at 2000 °C, W content of more than 30 at.% for high-temperature strength and operability up to 2000 °C, narrow solidification range for additive manufacturability, competitive ductility metrics, among other property constraints. We evaluated the mechanical properties and microstructure of 58 alloys designed in 5 batches, in both as-cast and homogenized conditions, synthesized using vacuum arc melting, utilizing scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Vickers microhardness, nanoindentation, and high-temperature compression testing. Based on the microhardness screening experiments in each batch, the best-performing alloys were selected for scale-up. High-temperature compression at 1800 °C was performed in these alloys, demonstrating that the designed alloys exhibit up to five times higher yield strength than a pure tungsten benchmark.

In this work, a series of NbTiVxZr high-entropy alloys (HEAs) with low density were formulated to explore the evolution of microstructures and mechanical properties with varying vanadium content. When the vanadium content was low, the matrix exhibited the single-phase body-centered cubic structure. Excessive vanadium contents (NbTiV0.75Zr, NbTiVZr) disrupted phase stability and tended to aggregate at grain boundaries, forming V-rich and Zr-rich phases. These precipitated phases pinned grain boundaries, impeding grain growth and resulting in both grain boundary strengthening and precipitation strengthening, albeit at the expense of grain boundary cohesion, ultimately leading to brittleness. However, these deleterious phases were redissolved, and fracture elongation increased more than 2 times after water quenching at 1200 °C. The microstructural changes induced by heat treatment were corroborated by alterations in grain boundary relaxation behavior, where the redissolution of precipitated phases after water quenching caused a shift of the grain boundary relaxation internal friction peak to a lower temperature and an increase in peak height.

The typical interfacial microstructure and the effect of brazing temperature on the microstructure and mechanical properties were thoroughly discussed. The results indicated the formation of complex oxides on the ZrO2 ceramic side, including Ti2O, Ni2Ti4O and (Hf, Ta, Zr)O2. Additionally, the RHEA substrate near the brazing seam underwent a transformation from a single BCC phase to double BCC phases, which included a TaNb-rich BCC-1 phase and a Zr-rich BCC-2 phase. The formation of the double BCC phases was caused by the spinodal decomposition. As the brazing temperature rose, the thickness of the oxides layer slightly increased and the double BCC phases formed from the beginning and progressively coarsened. The maximum room shear strength was 124.1 MPa when the joint was obtained at 1040 °C for 10 min.

In this study, an ultrafine-grained (UFG) NbMoTaW alloy with high grain-boundary cohesion was prepared by powder metallurgy, taking advantages of rapid hot-pressing sintering and full-process inert atmosphere protection from powder synthesis to sintering. By oxygen control and an increase in the proportion of grain boundaries, the segregation of oxygen and formation of oxides at grain boundaries were strongly mitigated, thus the intrinsic high cohesion of the interfaces was preserved.

These as-cast RHEAs having dendritic and inter-dendritic regions were found to be enriched in W and Ta, and Mo, Nb and Ti respectively. The microhardness of these RHEAs was investigated through instrumented indentation techniques. The microhardness of the BCC1 and BCC2 phases was found to be ∼4.5 GPa and 5.7 GPa. Further, the influence of Ti addition on the structure, elastic constant, and microhardness were estimated from the perspective of the first principle approximation.

The peak Au concentration of the CrNbZrMoV, TiCrZrMoV, TiNbCrMoV, TiNbZrCrV and TiNbZrMoCr coatings under 1.0 × 1016 ions/cm2 fluence are 4.27 × 103, 4.12 × 103, 4.13 × 103, 4.16 × 103 and 4.37 × 103 appm, respectively. The surface morphology of the CrNbZrMoV, TiCrZrMoV, TiNbZrCrV and TiNbZrMoCr coatings were smoothed obviously. For BCC TiNbCrMoV coating, irradiation caused the growth of the nanocrystalline. For amorphous coatings, the crystallization occurred in the CrNbZrMoV, TiCrZrMoV and TiNbZrMoCr coatings after 2.5 × 1015 fluence irradiation (≥12 dpa), while the TiNbZrCrV coating remain mainly amorphous structure after all irradiation. It was found that irradiation induced continuous crystallization occurred not only at the surface but also in the peak damage zone of the coating, and then grew inside the irradiated region. Apparent irradiation hardening was observed in all the coatings except the TiNbZrCrV coating. The structural stability of these coatings under the current irradiation condition was discussed. Preliminary study shows that the great irradiation tolerance of amorphous TiNbZrCrV coating may be related to the lowest electronegativity difference (Δχ = 0.121) and large atomic size difference (δ = 9.042 %) that stabilize the structure and inhibit atomic diffusion, respectively. These findings provide the guidance for the development of high irradiation tolerance materials for future nuclear energy applications with great structural stability. © 2024",

However, their performance is compromised by the trade-off required between strength and ductility. Here, a novel W30Ta5(FeNi)65 refractory high-entropy alloy with an outstanding combination of strength and plasticity at both room and elevated temperatures is designed, based on the multi-phase transitions design strategy. The alloy comprises a body-centered cubic dendrite phase, a topologically close-packed μ rhombohedral phase, and a high-density coherent nano-precipitate γ″ phase with the D022structure (Ni3Ta type) embedded in a continuous face-centered cubic matrix. Owing to precipitation strengthening of D022, the yield stress of the alloy is determined as high as 1450 MPa, which is a significant improvement (∼100%) in comparison with the D022-free alloy, without a loss of ductility. This alloy exhibits an excellent high-temperature strength, with the yield strengths of 1300 MPa at 600 °C and 320 MPa at 1000 °C. Detailed microstructural characterization using transmission electron microscopy, high-angle annular dark-field imaging, and three-dimensional atom probe tomography analyses indicated that this superior strength–plasticity combination stems from the synergy of a multiple-phase structure.

The as-cast Al7(NbTiZr)93 alloy exhibits a single-phase BCC structure, with a yield strength (YS) of 1050 MPa at room temperature. The addition of Mo and Ta leads to the formation of Al7(NbTiZrMo)93 and Al7(NbTiZrTa)93 alloys with BCC-B2 and B2-FCC dual-phase structures, whose YS values reach 1741 MPa and 2350 MPa, respectively. At 800 °C, trace amounts of ordered B2 phase are generated in the Al7(NbTiZr)93 matrix, and the YS decreases from 1050 MPa at room temperature to 219 MPa at 800 °C. In the Al7(NbTiZrMo)93 alloy, the 10 nm B2 precipitates grow to several hundred nanometers, and the YS decreases to 431 MPa after compression at 800 °C. In the Al7(NbTiZrTa)93 alloy, the grid B2-FCC structure at room temperature transforms into a disordered BCC structure at 800 °C, yet possessing the YS of 908 MPa and demonstrating acceptable ductility.

However, in tension, the fracture strengths, σf, of both columnar and equiaxed microstructures are far lower - below 70 MPa - and the material fails in the elastic regime without showing any measurable ductility at all temperatures. The fracture mechanisms in tension transition from transgranular cleavage at RT to a mixture of transgranular and intergranular fracture at 800 °C to a complete intergranular fracture at 1200 °C due to selective weakening of the metal oxide layer on the grain boundaries driven by a structural change. The transition in the fracture mechanism in the equiaxed microstructure promotes extrinsic toughening at higher temperatures, resulting in a ⁓6.4 times higher fracture toughness (KIc ⁓10.3 MPa√m) at 1200 °C compared to that at RT.

A significant increase in the yield and ultimate compressive strengths with rising strain rates up to 3.0 × 103 s−1 was observed and attributed to enhanced dislocation activities and stress-induced microstructural transformations. The formation of the B2 phase and Zr5Al3 precipitates was found to be crucial in bolstering the alloy strength at high strain rates. Beyond strain rates of 3.0 × 103 s−1, a decrease in strength occurred due to thermal softening and strain localization. Microstructural analyses at 3.5 × 103 s−1 revealed grain refinement, the development of micro shear bands, and dislocation tangles, which were indicative of dynamic recrystallization. Besides, the findings also revealed that the post-dynamic compression heat treatment further enhanced the hardness and microstructural stability of the alloy.

Herein, the effects of alloying elements on the mechanical and electronic properties of NbTaTiZrX (X = V, Mo, Hf, W and Re) RHEAs are investigated by using the density functional theory (DFT) in combination with the special quasi-random structure (SQS) and virtual crystal approximation (VCA) methods. The calculated results show that alloying of Mo, W and Re with high elastic modulus can enhance the strength and the hardness of RHEAs. Among them, NbTaTiZrRe RHEA with the best strengthening effect has a yield strength of exceeds 2 GPa, which is notably higher than other considered high-entropy alloys. For alloying of V and Hf, the ductility of RHEAs is improved, and among which, NbTaTiZrHf RHEA has a relatively best ductility. Compared with other NbTaTiZrX RHEAs, spiral dislocations in NbTaTiZrHf RHEA are more prone to nucleate, and which confirms its excellent ductility. Moreover, the reduction of pseudo energy gaps and the formation of Hf–Hf strong metallic bonds further confirm its metallic ductility from the electronic density of states and charge density.

Within the given range of O content, the single body-centered cubic (BCC) solid solution structure of the base alloy remained unchanged. However, the morphology of the dendrites displayed noticeable alterations with increase in oxygen content. The study revealed a positive correlation between the oxygen content and the hardness and yield strength of the alloys. This trend was attributed to the presence of oxygen atoms in the solid solution of the BCC matrix, which contributed to the alloy’s enhanced strength. The alloy containing 0.5 at.% oxygen exhibited the highest ductility among all the studied compositions. The improved ductility could be attributed to the relatively large fraction of the dendrites with smoother and blunt boundaries. These features effectively reduced stress concentration and increased the complexity of the facture surface, thereby enhancing the ductility of the alloy.

The Nb2MoxWyC0.25 alloy contain body-centered cubic (BCC) primary phase and eutectic structures composed of BCC and carbide phases with semi-coherent interfaces. Appropriate additions of Mo and W refine the grain size of the primary BCC phase and cause the carbide phase to evolve from Nb2C to NbC.

The yield strength of the alloy is about 1011 MPa with the tensile ductility of ∼12.6 %. Interestingly, the SHR of the alloy is very low, far below 1 GPa. The stress-strain curve of the alloy does not only show no premature dropout, but also exhibits a flat plateau-type curve. For this interesting phenomenon, the deformation mechanisms of Hf10Nb12Ti40V38 alloy are systematically investigated by investigating the deformation microstructures. The results indicate that the dislocation modes are diversifying, but the limited number of tangles generated by the intersection of dislocation channels are the main source of SHR. Various dislocation configurations such as single dislocation channel and cross-slip are stimulated sequentially, and although they have no positive effect on the SHR of the alloy, they allow alloy to accommodate plastic deformation. Combined with the kink bands as a strain softening mechanism, it improves the ductility while decreasing the SHR. Multiple dislocation channels interactions and kink bands are clearly identified as the two deformation mechanisms governing strain hardening and strain softening. The competition between two mechanisms generates the phenomenon mentioned above.

Ti addition resulted in a significant grain refinement (from 115 μm to 34 μm) of MoNb alloy. Exposure to high temperature for considerably longer duration (24 h at 1673 K) did not alter the beneficial effect of grain refinement imparted by Ti addition. Also, addition of Ti (33 at. %) significantly reduces the overall density without effecting the hardness of MoNbTi alloy, which is one of the key findings of the present study (MoNb - 4.06 ± 0.01 GPa, MoNbTi - 4.10 ± 0.01 GPa). MoNbTi also showed an exceptionally high “density-normalized” hardness when compared to various high-entropy alloys of similar family. Finally, from a simple analysis it is found that extraordinarily high “density-normalized” hardness can be obtained in just two/three element equiatomic systems, suggesting that developing new concentrated alloy systems with more than 3 elements in equiatomic proportion may not be offering any benefits with respect to hardness (strength) in single phase material systems where the beneficial effect of solid solution strengthening is exhausted. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

L21-Ni2TiAl was found as a strengthening phase in high entropy alloys (HEAs) which significantly improves room and elevated-temperature mechanical properties. To explore the potential application in RHEAs, we address the calculations of 7 refractory elements (i.e., V, Cr, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, and Ta) doping from first principles on the site preference, elastic properties and bonding effect of Ni2TiAl. The results show that the antisite defects is more stable than the vacancy defects. Elements Cr and Mo prefer the Ni-sites, while V, Zr, Nb, Hf, and Ta prefer the Ti-sites. Moreover, all the doping elements lead to a lattice shrinkage, among which V cause the largest distortion. For the normalized shear modulus (G/G0), all the elements increase except Nb, of which Hf rank the top. While for the normalized bulk modulus (B/B0), all the elements slightly increase except Hf. Furthermore, Nb is the only one to improve the toughness but has little impact on hardness (Hv), then Hf improves hardness the most. Additionally, all the doping elements decrease the anisotropy of Young's modulus for Ni2TiAl, of which Nb has the largest anisotropy, leading to a weak resistance to deformation. Notably, the density of states (DOS) shows that V and Cr can effectively improve the bonding stability and strength of Ni2TiAl. Overall, the alloying of Nb, V, and Cr may synergistically improve the stability and toughness of Ni2TiAl, which is expected to develop novel RHEAs. © 2023",

The microstructure, phase constituents, and mechanical properties of the refractory high-entropy alloy were studied in the present work. Most of these alloys exhibited typical dendrite morphology, except for the alloy Cr5. Excessive Cr results in the formation of TiZr-enriched zones. In addition, twins can appear in as-cast alloys as a result of a significant lattice mismatch between the matrix and the Laves phase, which is caused by the rapid cooling process during melting. All alloys demonstrate remarkable strength when exposed to high temperatures, with compressive yields surpassing 552 MPa, peaking at 712 MPa at 800 °C, and compressive strains exceeding 30%. Benefiting from the Laves phase, the alloys do not show significant softening, making it possible for this alloy to work stably at 800 °C. Analyses of high-temperature specimens under different degrees of deformation reveal that small-sized Laves phases containing nano-twins precipitate in the matrix. The small-sized Laves phases and nano-twins restrict the movement of dislocations, leading to a large amount of dislocation accumulation, which improves the strength and plasticity of the alloy.

Compared with some previously reported RHEAs, the TixZrNbMoV RHEAs prepared in this study possessed better comprehensive mechanical properties, with the specific yield strength of the TiZrNbMoV alloy being as high as 312 kPa·m3/kg.

The coatings were analyzed regarding their composition, surface and cross-sectional morphologies, microstructure, roughness, mechanical properties, oxidation resistance, and thermal stability. The structure of the deposited coatings reveals a transition from the bcc crystal structure to an amorphous phase as the V concentration increases. The addition of V also led to a decrease in roughness Ra and an improvement in adhesion, while it did not affect hardness, which remained at ∼10-11 GPa for all samples. Annealing under a protective atmosphere at 400 °C caused structural ordering, which was followed by an increase in mechanical properties. The purpose of the present paper is, therefore, to present a study on the deposition of TiZrNb coatings with increasing V concentration prepared by HiPIMS and to understand the role of V concentration on their structure, chemical composition, mechanical properties, and oxidation resistance.

However, these methods face challenges in concurrently improving the strength, plasticity, and high-temperature softening resistance of alloys. Here, we uncovered that stable isostructural coherent interfaces effectively address these challenges. In the model body-centered cubic (BCC) MoTaVW refractory high-entropy alloy (RHEA) fabricated by mechanical alloying and spark plasma sintering, controlling the sintering temperature enhances the preferential segregation of W at interfaces. This results in a distinct BCC W-enriched nanolayer between micrometer-scale grains. This nanolayer facilitates dislocation slip and prevents grain growth, thereby improving both plasticity and resistance to high-temperature softening. Consequently, the MoTaVW RHEA featuring stable isostructural coherent interfaces achieves an ultrahigh yield strength of 1410 MPa and a plasticity of 22 % at ambient temperature. Even at 1200 °C, it maintains a yield strength of 575 MPa under hot compression. © 2024 Acta Materialia Inc.",

The yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and elongation of the TiNbV0.5Ta0.5Cr0.1 alloy were 878 MPa, 928 MPa, and 21.6 %, respectively. Important issues of microstructure evolution, precipitation process, and their impact on mechanical properties were concerned. Then, the effect of Cr content on the mechanical properties of TiNbV0.5Ta0.5Crx alloys was evaluated through a quantitative analysis of the strengthening mechanism, which elucidated the trade-off relationship between solid solution strengthening and precipitation strengthening in RHEA. The microstructure evolution of the TiNbV0.5Ta0.5Crx alloys involved the formation and interconversion of titanium allotropes (α-Ti and β-Ti) and the precipitation of the Laves phase. Significant embrittlement was induced by the preferential precipitation of α-Ti on the grain boundary. The TiNbV0.5Ta0.5Crx alloys exhibited an incubation period for Laves phase precipitation, which was related to the Cr content in the alloy. The Laves phase preferentially nucleated next to α-Ti due to the redistribution of elements during the α-Ti precipitation process.

Here, we introduce multiple phases including FCC and HCP phases into the NbMoTa RMEA via appropriate addition of carbon. The results show that multiple-phase synergy effectively suppresses non-uniform deformation, thereby delaying the onset of vertical splitting cracks.

The FCC precipitates contain high-density stacking faults, acting as a dislocation source under compressive loading. The HCP phase in the eutectic microstructures, in turn, acts as a strong barrier to dislocation movement and simultaneously increases the dislocation storage capacity.

The characteristics of oxides and their effects on mechanical properties were systematically studied.

Attributing to the difference in cooling rate of molten pool, the typical dendrite is formed in VAMed NTT, while the microstructure in the SLMed NTT exhibits a mixed morphology of columnar and cellular grains. The component microscopic segregation occurs in the SLMed NTT due to the poor element diffusion caused by the insufficient powder mixing and short laser acting time.

The results indicate that the grain refinement does not significantly improve the high temperature strength of the NTT alloy. This is attributed to the fact that finer grains can easily slip at high temperatures, which leads to the weakening of the grain boundary strengthening effect. The high ductility (e>80 %) of NTT not only expands the application field of refractory alloys, but also the novel MEA is a promising candidate material for AM. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

However, since the body-centered cubic (BCC) structure is not close-packed, the change of lattice resistance is less sensitive to the normal concentration wave compared to that in face-centered cubic (FCC) structured materials. In this work, we selected a refractory bcc HEAs TiZrNbTa for the matrix and added a small amount of Al to facilitate the special spinodal decomposition structure. In particular, (TiZrNbTa)98.5Al1.5 displayed a typical basket-weave fabric morphology of spinodal decomposition structure with a characteristic periodicity of ∼8 nm and had an optimal combination of strength and ductility (the yield strength of 1123 ± 9 MPa and ductility of ∼20.7% ± 0.6%). It was determined that by doing in situ TEM mechanical testing, the plastic deformation was dominated by the formation and operation of dislocation loops which provided both edge and screw components of dislocations. The synergetic effect of the remarkable chemical heterogeneity created by the spinodal decomposition and the spreading lattice distortion in high entropy alloys is quite effective in tuning the mobility of different types of dislocations and facilitates dislocation interactions, enabling the combination of high strength and ductility. © 2022",

Due to the structure and properties of traditional alloys cannot meet the special performance requirements，new materials are urgently needed. Ni-based superalloy，which is widely used in high temperature materials，but it is limited by its own melting point and service temperature is only 1100~1150 ℃. The high temperature service range of materials restricts the use of blades for gas turbine and high-temperature structural materials，High melting point metal elements have unique advantages because of their own properties，so it is expected to improve the service temperature range of high temperature structural materials by using high melting point metal elements. Three kinds of high entropy alloys NbMoTiVSix（x=0，0.25，0.5）were melted in a non-consumable vacuum arc furnace. All the ingots were melted five times to improve the uniformity. The diameter of the button ingot was about 120 mm，the height was about 40 mm，and the weight was about 1500 g. The actual composition of the alloy was determined by gravimetry（Nb）and Inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry（Mo，Ti，V，Si）. All the test and analysis samples were taken from the middle of the ingot with the size of 10 mm×10 mm×10 mm. The compression specimen size was Φ10 mm×15 mm. Before annealing，the samples were packaged in a vacuum quartz tube and the heat treatment system was to raise the temperature to 1200 ℃ with the furnace，keep the temperature for 24 h，and then cool with the furnace. D/max-RB X-ray diffractometer（XRD）was used to analyze the phase of the sample. The scanning speed was 5（°）·min-1，scanning angle was 20°~120°. Vickers hardness of 11 points was measured by 430SWD hardness tester under 49.03N load，the loading time was 15 s. The composition ratio of corrosive agent was：NbMoTiV（HF∶HNO3=1∶1），NbMoTiVSi0.25（HF∶HNO3∶H2O=1∶1∶5）and NbMoTiVSi0.5 （HF∶HNO3∶H2O=1∶1∶8）（volume ratio）. The compression properties of the alloy at room temperature were tested by Instron 3369 air testing machine. The composition of the alloy before and after heat treatment was analyzed by scanning electron microscope（SEM，JSM-7900F）. The microstructure of the alloy was observed by JEM-2000FX analysis electron microscope and Tecnai G2 F20 field emission high resolution electron microscope（TEM）. XRD patterns of NbMoTiVSix（x=0，0.25，0.5）high entropy alloy showed that all the main diffraction peaks belonged to the typical body-centered cubic（bcc）solid solution phase，NbMoTiVSi0.25 and NbMoTiVSi0.5 alloys had a single structure. With the addition of Si，the new peaks appeared near the main peak of（110）crystal plane. The change of lattice constant could reflect the change trend of（110）main peak. The lattice constants of as cast and annealed NbMoTiV alloys were 0.3187 and 0.3042 nm. With the increase of Si content，the lattice constants of NbMoTiVSi0.25 and NbMoTiVSi0.5 alloys first decreased and then increased，the lattice constants of as cast alloys were 0.3192 and 0.3191 nm，while the annealed alloys were 0.3218 and 0.3203 nm. The microstructure of NbMoTiV alloy was observed to be single phase with coarse grain size of（200±50）µm. NbMoTiV alloy was a single bcc phase，while NbMoTiVSi0.25 and NbMoTiVSi0.5 alloys were bcc+M5Si3（M=Nb，Mo，Ti，V）biphasic structures. SEM images showed that the fracture surface of NbMoTiV alloy presented fluvial pattern，NbMoTiVSi0.25 alloy was obviously diphasic and had microcracks and a few dimples，and NbMoTiVSi0.5 alloy changed from silicide to eutectic of secondary bcc solid solution phase and silicide phase with the further increase of Si content，and the silicide was chrysanthemum like distributed among the dendrites. The mechanical properties of the alloy were analyzed and the results showed that with the increase of Si content，the hardness increased from HV 358.3 of NbMoTiV to HV 660.7 of NbMoTiVSi0.5. With the increase of Si content，the compressive strength of the alloy increased from 1747 MPa of NbMoTiV to 2038 MPa of NbMoTiVSi0.5，while the fracture strain decreased from 30% to 16%. The fracture surface of NbMoTiV alloy presented fluvial pattern，while the fracture surface of NbMoTiVSi0.5 alloy showed a lot of river-like patterns，feathery patterns，step and crack. With the increase of Si content，the brittle fracture characteristics of the alloy were obvious. © 2023 Editorial Office of Chinese Journal of Rare Metals. All rights reserved.,

The solidification thermodynamics, microstructure and mechanical properties (compressive strength at 25 °C) of the four alloys were analyzed, and the strengthening mechanism of TN20 alloy was studied. The compressive yield strength of the four alloys exceeds 2050 MPa, the ultimate compressive strength exceeds 2550 MPa, and the elongation exceeds 9%. The compressive yield strength of TN20 alloy is 2513 MPa, the ultimate strength is 3127 MPa, and the elongation is 11.38%. The room temperature (25 °C) compressive yield strength of TN20 alloy is the highest among the high entropy alloys studied so far. TN20 alloy is composed of BCC matrix phase and grain boundary phase containing three different structures, which are B2 TiNi phase, Ni55Nb25Ti15Ta5 phase generating stacking faults and Ni70Ti20Nb10 secondary precipitated phase. The micrometer matrix phase and nanometer grain boundary phase of TN20 alloy show a network distribution in fine crystal region. After the matrix phase cracks due to high thermal stress, the flow TiNi-rich grain boundary phases precipitate to fill the cracks. The grain boundary phase with high proportion in this region is enhanced by the secondary phase and its nanoprecipitated phase. In other regions, stacking faults are generated by the Ni55Nb25Ti15Ta5 phases, which convert the thermal stress that induces crack into lattice defects of the crystal. On the other hand, the content of B2 phase is the highest in grain boundary phase, and the grain boundary between B2 phase and matrix phase is a coherent grain boundary, which realizes the high quality combination of grain boundary phase and matrix phase. The design and strengthening of WNbMoTa-based non-equimolar RHEAs are studied in this paper, which is expected to provide a reference for the design of a new generation of high entropy alloy. © 2023",

At room temperature, the yield strength of AlxNb0.5TiV2Zr0.5 alloys increases obviously at first and then decreases slightly with the range of 843 MPa–1727 MPa. The compressive strain of the alloys obviously decreases from 33.4% to 13.7% at first and then increases to 16.6%. Upon increasing the temperature to 873 and 1073 K, the strength of all alloys decreases, and the yield strength of the Al0.8 alloy remains 1569 and 1108 MPa, respectively. The compression ratios of all AlxNb0.5TiV2Zr0.5 alloys reach 50% without fracture at this temperature.

All the as-milled Tix(x=0.5–2)AlV0.5CrMo powders were found to present a single body-centered cubic (BCC) phase structure. At high temperature above 1200 °C, however, the disordered BCC2 and hexagonal Al2O3 phases formed from the metastable BCC solid solution. The grain sizes of both the BCC and the newly-formed BCC2 and Al2O3 phases were in the range of 0.13–0.41 μm. By referring to the empirical parameters and non-equilibrium solidification theory, the phase transformation in the SPS sintering process was discussed in detail. Mechanical tests showed that the Tix(x=0.5–2)AlV0.5CrMo RHEAs possessed ultra-high specific strength, due to the solid solution strengthening, grain size refinement strengthening, precipitation strengthening and hetero-deformation induced (HDI) hardening.

The roughness of the surfaces and sections cut using WEDM was compared. Average surface roughness (Ra) increased by approximately 0.75 μm due to the limited heat transfer capability of the dielectric fluid in removing debris and cooling the interior of the sample. SEM and EDS analyses taken from the machined surfaces revealed microcracks, voids, globules, craters, and debris formed on the surface because of the sudden cooling of the dielectric liquid after melting and evaporation under intense heat.

The presence of the third phases suggested that a part of the RHEA contents diffused into the TiCXN1-X phases to form some compounds or solid solutions. Changes in mechanical properties of the composites such as hardness and bending stress as a function of temperature were influenced by the ratio of TiN to TiC in TiCxN1-x grains; the higher ratio of TiN was better for the high temperature mechanical properties and oxidation resistance whereas a partly replacement of TiN with TiC was better to improve the mechanical properties of the composites over the wide temperature range (R.T. to 1473 K). © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",

We consider the factors affecting the structure of high-entropy alloys (HEAs) based on elements Ti, Zr, Hf, V, and Nb. The structures of four-component Ti25Zr25V25Nb25 and five-component Ti20Zr20Hf20V20Nb20 alloys fabricated under the same melting and cooling conditions in an arc furnace are studied. Energy dispersive chemical analysis demonstrates that the chemical compositions of the alloys correspond to the nominal ones. Based on an analysis of micrographs of the ingot surfaces, we conclude that the melting conditions lead to overheating of the four-component alloy and do not cause overheating of the five-component. The primary formation of the four-component alloy is found to occur faster than that of the five-component one; however, further remelting under overheating conditions brings about the formation of a multiphase structure. The maximum content of the bcc solid solution (98%) in the Ti25Zr25V25Nb25 alloy is achieved during the first remelting, and another phase (2%) was an fcc solid solution. The maximum content of the bcc solid solution (95%) in the Ti20Zr20Hf20V20Nb20 alloy is achieved during repeated remelting, and bcc and hcp solid solutions and a Laves phase are present in an amount of 3%. The unit cell parameters of the main bcc phases in the Ti25Zr25V25Nb25 and Ti20Zr20Hf20V20Nb20 alloys are 3.270 and 3.362 Å, respectively. The choice of temperature–time conditions of melting and solidification for each specific alloy composition is shown to be important along with the fulfillment of thermodynamic conditions for the production of refractory single-phase HEAs. © 2023, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",

In this study, the WMoTaNb-Y2O3 refractory high-entropy alloy coatings were produced on Inconel 718 by laser cladding to improve the microhardness and high-temperature wear resistance of the substrate. The phase composition, microstructure, and mechanical properties of the HEAs were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), microhardness, and wear resistance tests. The results show that due to the high entropy effect and elemental diffusion, the WMoTaNb-Y2O3 refractory high-entropy alloy coatings comprise simple BCC and Fe-containing phases. Y2O3 particles are mainly distributed at the surface of the high-entropy alloys coatings. Y2O3 particles have an advantage in the inhibition of HEAs grain growth attributed to a strong pinning effect. The microhardness and the wear resistance of the HEA composite improved significantly with the addition of Y2O3 particles. A good comprehensive mechanical properties was obtained at the HEA with the addition of 3 wt% Y2O3 particles, which microhardness can reach to 1274.6 HV0.2. The laser-cladded WMoTaNb-Y2O3 high-entropy alloy coatings show a good wear performance at high temperature, which is mainly attributed to the formation of oxide films on the surface of the coating.

Experimental observations show that the homogenized sample exhibits a relatively uniform microstructure containing body-centered-cubic (BCC), hexagonal closed-packed (HCP) and a few face-centered cubic (FCC) phases, while the HCP structures display two chemical compositions. The subsequent hot extrusion promotes the formation of hierarchical heterostructure which is composed of elongated coarse dendrites and extremely fine dynamically recrystallized mixtures. The BCC and FCC phases exhibit different morphologies and chemical compositions. Upon annealing, equiaxed BCC and HCP grains, slender BCC dendrites, and two types of FCC particles dominate the microstructures. Compared to reported refractory HEAs, the present alloys exhibit an good balance between elongation and specific strength. Compared with the homogenized sample, the strength of the hot-extruded sample is significantly improved, while annealing after hot extrusion induces larger ductility.

Alloying elements decrease the stability of the bcc against the face-centered cubic (fcc) and the hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structures. Scandium enlarges the lattice constants of equiatomic and non-equiatomic systems significantly. According to the calculated bulk modulus to shear modulus, Poisson's ratio and Vickers hardness, all studied equiatomic and non-equiaomic systems are found to be ductile. However, alloying elements Al, Ni and Cu reduce the ductility and improve the hardness of equiatomic and non-equiatomic TiVNbMoM systems, while the ductility (hardness) of non-equiatomic systems enhances (reduces) by substitution with Sc element. The present theoretical results provide insight for the design and improvement of high entropy alloys and complete information on the alloying effects. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

Significant breakthroughs are expected in multinary materials whose efficient exploration necessitates dedicated strategies. The exploration of a refractory high entropy alloy Nb-Ti-Zr-Cr-Mo is proposed here as test case for a new strategy. Based on the proven methodology of mixture design and on combinatorial thin film metallurgy, the composition space is explored by a limited number of chosen gradients to build an alloy library comprising hardness and ductility, two antagonistic properties. The workflow is showcased here by studying the properties of the as-grown graded film, which presents wide amorphous domains and contrasted mechanical properties. This experimental dataset then trains machine learning models to provide continuous predictions of the alloy properties over the entire composition space. We show that optimal alloy properties are expected close to the binary edges of the quinary. © 2023 The Author(s)",

In this paper, we propose a supervised machine learning framework powered by the distributed breeder genetic algorithm (DBGA) to train a charge transfer ionic potential (CTIP) for the multi-component Hf/Nb/Ta/Ti/Zr/O system. By combining the DBGA with extensive ab initio training data and a carefully designed objective function, a robust and extrapolative potential with massive internal parameters is effectively optimized. A cross-validation of the CTIP is rigorously performed to verify its accuracy in predicting energetic, structural and mechanical properties of metals, intermetallic compounds, alloys and oxides. Using the developed potential, we further study the atomic structure and its evolution in RHEA to reveal the deformation and oxidation mechanisms in response to mechanical loadings and oxygen atmospheres. The simulation results not only provide valuable atomistic information hardly accessible through experiments and thermodynamic calculations, but also display promising prospects for large-scale reactive simulations of the Hf/Nb/Ta/Ti/Zr/O complex-component system. © 2023 The Author(s)",

Inspires from mature Ni and Co-based superalloys, a novel Al20Co36Cr4Fe4Ni36 EHEA was designed and prepared to obtain good mechanical properties at both room temperature and high temperatures in this study. The novel EHEA consists of a L12 phase and a B2 phase with a superior ultra-tensile strength of 1005 ± 40 MPa and a ductility of 8.8 ± 0.4% at room temperature. The engineering compressive stress–strain curves at 1073 K indicated that the current EHEA performs a high strength of 321 ± 9 MPa without fracture even at a high temperature of ~0.6 TE, which is even superior to some refractory high entropy alloys (RHEAs). The hot deformation behavior and microstructure evolution of the new EHEA was investigated at the temperature range of 1073 K to 1273 K and various strain rates from 10−3 s−1 to 10−1 s−1. The constitutive equation that describes the correlations between the flow stress, strain rate, and temperatures was constructed. Continuous dynamic recrystallization (CDRX) was the primary dynamic recrystallization (DRX) mechanism in both the L12 and B2 phases during hot deformation. However, the proportion of dynamic recrystallization grains in the L12 phase is higher than that in the B2 phase according to the high angle grain boundaries (HAGBs) under the same deformation condition, suggesting that the CDRX kinetics was faster and stronger in the L12 phase. The present study provided a new thought for designing EHEAs and an insight into the hot deformation behavior of EHEAs with lamellar morphologies. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",

Here we show a significant size effect on the strength, plasticity and fracture behaviour of the VNbMoTaW RHEA. As sample size goes from millimeter to sub-micrometer scale, the brittle cracking behavior of the RHEA is greatly suppressed, along with a simultaneous enhancement of strength and plasticity. The improved mechanical properties can be attributed to the disappearance of crack initiation sites, the size-dependent dislocation plasticity at small length scale and the size-dependent competition in thermodynamics driving-force for cleavage cracking and plastic yielding.

Most of these alloys display a remarkable strength at temperatures above 1000 ∘C, which cannot be explained by the standard model of bcc plasticity dominated by thermally-activated screw dislocation motion. Recent research on Nb-Mo-Ta-W alloys points to a heightened role of edge dislocations during mechanical deformation, which is generally attributed to atomic-level chemical fluctuations in the material and their interactions with dislocation cores during slip. However, while this effect accounts for levels of strength that are larger than what might be found in a pure metal, it is not sufficient to explain the high yield stress found at elevated temperatures, particularly in the so-called strength ‘plateau’ region. In this work, we propose a strengthening mechanism based on the existence of thermal super-jogs in edge dislocations that act as strong obstacles to dislocation motion. The basis for the formation of these super-jogs is found in the unique properties of RMEA, which display vacancy formation energy distributions with tails that extend to almost zero energy. This facilitates vacancy formation at dislocation cores, which subsequently relax into atomic-sized super-jogs. While these super-jogs result in alloy strengthening in a wide temperature range, they can also displace diffusively along the glide direction, relieving with their motion some of this extra stress and eventually leading to strength softening above 2000 K. We implement these mechanisms into a specially-designed hybrid kinetic Monte Carlo/Discrete Dislocation Dynamics approach (kMC/DD) parameterized with vacancy formation and migration energy distributions obtained with machine-learning potentials designed specifically for the Nb-Mo-Ta-W system. The kMC module sets the timescale dictated by thermally-activated events, while the DD module relaxes the dislocation line configuration in between events in accordance with elastic forces and the applied stress. We find that the balance between super-jog pinning and super-jog diffusion confers an extra strength to edge dislocations at intermediate-to-high temperatures which is consistent with the experimental observation of a strength plateau in equiatomic Nb-Mo-Ta-W. We derive an analytical model based on the computational results that captures this improved understanding of plastic processes in these alloys and could help to partially explain the strength measurements at high temperatures. © 2022 The Author(s)",

However, the main structure typically transitions from disordered BCC to ordered B2 with increasing Al concentration, leading to poor ductility. In the present study, a phase inversion in a high-Al-content B2-RHEA (Zr40Ti28Nb12Al20) was systematically studied through thermo-mechanical treatment. The grains of the single B2 phase transformed inversely to the BCC + B2 microstructure with a dispersion of spherical B2 precipitates in the BCC grains. The evolution of the microstructure began with the decomposition of the B2 phase into Al-rich and Al-poor regions. The subsequent coarsening of the Al-rich B2 precipitates continuously consumes Al and Zr atoms from the solution. The depletion of Al and Zr in the matrix drives it to gradually form the disordered BCC structure and eventually transform to a single BCC phase matrix. This phase inversion enhanced tensile ductility of the RHEA while still maintaining its high specific strength. The current study provides a novel idea for inhibiting Al-induced brittleness of RHEAs at high Al content. © 2023",

However, the deformation and fatigue failure mechanisms of these alloys under cyclic loading remain poorly understood. The present work addresses this issue by investigating the low-cycle deformation behavior and microstructural evolution of an HfNbTiZr RHEA with a nominal composition of 25 mol% each of Hf, Nb, and Ti, and Zr forming the balance under symmetric tension-compression conditions at room temperature. Analysis of the cyclic stress responses of the alloy reveals a variety of internal stress trends at different strain amplitudes (Δεa), which implies the operations of a variety of cyclic deformation mechanisms. Further analysis demonstrates that cyclic softening is mainly caused by a rapid decrease in frictional stress during the initial cycles representing roughly 10% of the total number of cycles to failure. In general, the microstructural characteristics of the alloy observed with an increasing number of cycles under various values of Δεa demonstrate that softening occurs due to the formation of slip bands (SBs) caused by high-density dislocations arising in conjunction with increasing plastic strain accumulation. Specifically, dislocation structures forming at a low value of Δεa = 0.8% mainly consist of planar SBs (PSBs), while low-density cross SBs (CSBs) form at Δεa = 1.1%, and the density of the CSBs increases with further increasing Δεa. In addition, a fatigue lifetime prediction model was presented that obtained good prediction accuracy for the HfNbTiZr RHEA investigated herein. Accordingly, the present study can be expected to provide a fundamental basis for understanding the deformation mechanisms of other RHEAs. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",

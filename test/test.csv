In present work, a novel design strategy based on tailoring element distribution is proposed to achieve excellent high-temperature strength at a density lower than 7 g cm−3. Specifically, a Ti40Nb15Mo30(NbC)15 composite was designed and prepared by powder metallurgy. The composite is found to be composed of two ultrafine-grained (UFG) phases including a body-centered cubic (bcc) solid-solution phase and a face-centered cubic (fcc) ceramic reinforcement phase (Ti, Nb)C. The as-sintered composite shows a uniform and UFG microstructure where two phases are interconnected. Due to this unique microstructure, the Ti40Nb15Mo30(NbC)15 composite displays superb specific yield strengths among surveyed RHEAs, complex concentrated alloys, and metal-matrix composites from 800 °C (243 MPa g−1 cm3) to 1000 °C (127 MPa g−1 cm3). The outstanding high-temperature compressive strength was found to be associated with high resistance to dislocation motion and strong dislocation interactions in both the bcc and fcc phases. The phase interface after hot compression remained semi-coherent, vindicating its high stability. The high-density of stable phase interfaces not only retards the dislocation motion due to the large image force near the phase boundary but also induces a high value of activation energy for diffusion. The high activation energy can further achieve significant microstructure stability even after a long-term annealing (36 h) at 1000 °C. This work provides new perspectives for the design and application of light and ultrastrong refractory complex concentrated alloys (RCCAs) by comparison to the insufficient strength of many traditional and light RCCAs. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",

In this work, we conceived a facile route to achieve an excellent combination of high-temperature strength and room-temperature ductility in a NbMoTaWHf refractory high-entropy alloy (RHEA). The idea is to break up the stable single body-centered cubic (BCC) phase in NbMoTaW RHEA to introduce the tiny secondary phase by alloying appropriate hafnium (Hf) that can stall and accumulate dislocations. The dual-BCC-phase structure and the dislocations for the NbMoTaWHf RHEA were characterized. The compressive yield strengths of the NbMoTaWHf RHEA at room temperature, 1200, 1600, and 1800 °C were 1730, 1088, 390, and 312 MPa, respectively. The alloy displayed plastic deformation behaviors and dual-BCC-phase structure stability after compressing at 1600 and 1800 °C. The superb high-temperature strength was mainly ascribed to the high softening temperature, second-phase strengthening, and solid-solution strengthening. This work provides a promising high-temperature structural material with improved room-temperature ductility and high strength at elevated temperatures and enriches the database of the NbMoTaW-based RHEAs. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",
